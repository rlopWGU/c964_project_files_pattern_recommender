PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
------------
This program is designed to process user input queries for knitting or crochet patterns and return the top 5 resulting pattern suggestions. The program contains scripts that gather and process a significant volume of pattern data from a public, popular pattern source known as Ravelry. The goal of this data processing (which includes POS tagging, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings, and Cosine Similarity) is to produce a well rounded matrix of the pattern data organized according to their similarities. User input queries are then processed similarly and the top five most similar pattern results are returned to the terminal in a table.

INFORMATION FOR USE
------------
Instructions on how to use the application. The application is ready to use in a Jupyter Lab environment upon downloading its files. 
1. Install Jupyter Lab (if not already installed on your machine).
  - Open the command line, type “pip install jupyterlab”, and press enter.
  - Wait for the installation to complete.
2. Open the project in the Jupyter Lab environment.
  - Open the command line, type "jupyter lab", and press enter.
  - Navigate to main.ipynb in the project files and open the file.
3. Run the main.ipynb script
  - This script performs any necessary installations of tools and libraries needed to use the program.
4. Interact with the program's UI using the terminal.
  - There are several options in the UI, including: submitting a pattern search query, menu, execute data collection and processing, view data visualizations, and exit the program.
5. To close the program, type "menu" in the terminal and press enter, followed by "3" and press enter.
6. To view the search results log, open "search_results.csv".

DATASET ATTRIBUTION
This project utilizes publicly available knitting and crochet pattern metadata collected from [Ravelry](https://www.ravelry.com). The dataset consists of pattern titles, designer names, descriptions, fiber types, skill levels, and tags, which were scraped from publicly accessible pattern pages.
All pattern designs, names, and metadata remain the intellectual property of their respective creators. This dataset was collected solely for research and educational purposes to improve search capabilities using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
If you are a designer and have concerns about your pattern metadata being included in this dataset, please contact us for removal.
