The first center section features chevron stripes with the MC (main color) and AC (accent color) along with a fun 3D loop effect. Each section is knitted modularly by picking up stitches or knitting the new section together with a previous section.

The final symmetrical shape has a long wingspan and lots of geometric angles to showcase your beautiful fingering weight yarn.

It’s always good to have some extra stitch markers and split ring markers in case you want to use them while you knit the shawl. Make sure your cable needle is a similar thickness to your knitting needle.
Gauge 24 sts & 52 rows = 4″ / 10cm in garter stitch before blocking.
Try to get close to the recommended stitch gauge to ensure you don’t run out of yarn. A similar stitch gauge is more important than getting an exact row gauge. Work with a needle size that creates a fabric that you like.

From Schoolhouse Press:
Elizabeth Zimmermann’s Baby Surprise Jacket has become near legendary since its conception in 1968, from the newsletter #21. The jacket is knitted back and forth in Garter stitch, then cleverly folded and completed by weaving the shoulder seams. This updated pattern includes Elizabeth’s original Baby Surprise Jacket instructions, original Adult Surprise instructions (with added sizing help), and instructions for a Child’s Surprise jacket. We include row by row instructions for the Baby Surprise Jacket. Cully has added numbers to knit the original size jacket with different gauges. Includes notes on color placement, options for hood, collar and more - plus instructions for EZ’s Afterthought Pocket, One-Row buttonhole and more. The Surprise pattern is part of an exciting project, upcoming by 2016. For now, the pattern is available only in Print.
Print version comes in a 3-hole, archival quality sheet protector.
The jacket is knit in a single piece with just two seams that run across the shoulders and down the length of the sleeves. It includes extra ease across the back of the garment to fit well over a nappy (diaper).
Commonly referred to as the “BSJ”, the baby surprise jacket is “a very entertaining piece of knitted engineering”
Materials: 3 oz. of baby wool (6 sts to 1”) (sport-weight to dk) or 2 skeins Fisherman Yarn (5 sts to 1”) (dk to worsted)
1 pr. needles in the size to give you either of these gauges.

This pattern first appeared in Newsletter #21, Fall 1968.

Mariechen is worked seamlessly from the top down. The cardigan is worked back and forth with raglan increases to shape the yoke. Fronts are worked in Double Seed Stitch with a cute textured cable/lace panel down the center. Once yoke shaping is complete, sleeve stitches are placed on hold to work the body first top down to the hem. Buttonhole band, button band and neck finishing are worked next. Sleeve sts are then picked up again to work the sleeves top down in the round to the cuffs. As this cardigan is worked from the top down it is advisable to try it on from time to time to check the length and overall fit. The length and width of the yoke are easily adjustable by adding/ reducing increases or underarm sts.

The cardigan is worked in stockinette stitch, while the edges are worked in rib.

Size Guide and Measurements Please note that knitting to the correct gauge is essential to end up with a garment that has the measurements given in the pattern.
The sizes XS (S) M (L) XL (2XL) 3XL (4XL) 5XL are designed to fit an approximate bust circumference of 80-85 (85-90) 90-95 (95-100) 100-110 (110-120) 120-130 (130-140) 140-150 cm [31½-33½ (33½-35½) 35½-37½ (37½-39½) 39½-43¼ (43¼-47¼) 47¼-51¼ (51¼-55) 55-59 inches]. The Novice Cardigan – Mohair Edition is designed to have approx. 10 cm [4 inches] of positive ease, meaning it is designed to be approx. 10 cm [4 inches] larger in circumference than your body.
This means that if you, for example, measure 90 cm [35½ inches] around your bust or widest upper body part (measure yourself around your bust, or your widest point, using a measuring tape), you should knit a size S which has a circumference of 100 cm [39¼ inches].

Pattern Notes For a striped shawl, change colors whenever you like. Change colors at the beginning of any RS row. If you want to have a striped look like the large striped version, then add an accent stripe for the yarn over RS and WS rows like Rows 7 & 8, Rows 9 & 10, Rows 11 & 12, etc… These accent stripes feature a contrasting color for only 2 rows (or 1 garter ridge). Then, knit the entire short row wedge in another color. For strong graphic contrast, select yarn over accent stripes (the single garter ridge stripes) that are much brighter or darker than the short row wedge colors.
For a 3-color faded version of Dotted Rays, follow the original PDF for Dotted Rays along with these color fading notes:
Cast on and begin with color A (the lightest color). Once you have approximately 30g remaining of color A, begin striping color A & color B together using each color for 2 rows. When you start striping colors, try to introduce color A when you begin a new short row wedge. For example, start striping colors A & B on any numbered row like Row 23 or Row 25. These are the “yo twice” rows which begin a new short row wedge. Once you finish color A, use color B on its own until you have about 30g remaining of color B. Then stripe color B & color C together for 2 rows each until you are out of color B. Finish the shawl with C on its own. You can bind off after completing any even numbered WS row. For example, you can bind off early after completing Row 30 or you can bind off after Row 32. If you have more yarn and want to continue knitting the large size, you can bind off after Rows 34, 36, or 38.

DETAILS This shawl is meant to inspire your playful side! Try experimenting with gauge to play with the size of the shawl, explore different color possibilities, hold a couple strands of yarn together, or even better - spin your own yarn! The stitch pattern lends itself beautifully to a relaxing knit, but its unique construction makes it fun to knit again and again! My sincere hope is that this will be the type of shawl you knit on repeat. Once you are familiar with the pattern at the gauges listed, I hope you will try it out again with your own yarn combinations to create different size shawls for different occasions!
SIZES 1 (2)
FINISHED MEASURMENTS Wingspan - 75 (91.5)”/190.5 (232.5) cm Center Depth - 24 (25)”/61 (63.5) cm
YARN REQUIREMENTS These are just approximations. Total yarn usage will depend on the yarn you use (fiber content, ply, etc.), your personal gauge, and any modifications you may make.
Sample A (Size 1/warm colors): 325 g/ 850 yds/777 m of Sport Weight Handspun Wool Yarn
Sample B (Size 2/cool colors): 420 g/830 yds/759 m of DK/Worsted Weight Handspun Wool yarn
SUGGESTED YARN For this shawl I chose my own handspun! Both of my samples were combo spins - meaning I picked 3 braids of fiber that had colors that looked nice together, and spun them as traditional 3-ply yarns using a short forward draft. (You can photos of the fiber/yarn included with the pattern photos!) But don’t worry - you don’t need to be a handspinner! The sky is the limit when choosing yarns for this shawl. It looks just as amazing knit up in a one color farmy neutral, as it does marled, color blocked or faded! (Oh my - it would be so good faded!) To get you started, I reached out to Spincycle Yarns for that handspun look and my fellow “Traveler” collaborators to see how they would knit this shawl up, and am including their ideas below. As always, you can also find a list of budget-friendly yarns in the PDF linked at the bottom of this page!
Sample A (Size 1/warmer colors): Handspun yarn Fiber dyed by Hello Yarn for the Fiber Club: “Nesselrode” - Corriedale/”Botany” - Rambouillet/”Just a Glimpse” - American Wool - 1 braid of each, spun as a classic 3 ply combo spin that came out to about 12 WPI.
Sample B (Size 2/cooler colors): Handspun yarn; Fiber dyed by Wound Up Fiber Arts & Hello Yarn: “Best of You” - Rambouillet/”Brick Wall” - Limited Edition Wool Top/”Popple” - Superfine Merino - 2 braids of each, spun as a classic 3 ply combo spin that came out to about 10 WPI
Sample C (Size 2/dark grey/blue): Ritual Dyes Elder 100% USA grown Rambouillet Wool (100 g/190 yds/173 m) - 6 skeins Chromite
Sample D (Size 1/red): The Farmer’s Daughter Fibers Soka’pii 100% Non-Superwash MT & WY Rambouillet (50 g/248 yards/227 m) - 4 skeins Flower Point held together with Oh Dang! 74% Suri Alpaca/26% Silk (50 g/328 yards/300 m) - 2 skeins Flower Point
Sample E (Size 1/shades of grey & pink) La Bien Aimée Kumo 65% Baby Suri Alpaca/35% Silk (50 g/437 yds/400 m) - 2 skein Fiori held together with Alix 70% Falkland Merino/30% Suri Alpaca (100 g/710 yds/650 m) - 2 skeins of Fiori & 1 mini skein of Fluoro Morganite
Sample F (Size 1/multi with pinks & mints) Spincycle Yarns Dyed in the Wool 100% SW American Wool (200 yds/182 m) - 4 skeins Bomboloni
Sample G (Size 2/multi yellows, blues and purples) Spincycle Yarns Dream State 100% SW American Wool (150 yds/137 m) - 7 skeins Strawflower
SUGGESTED NEEDLES Size 1 - US 6/4 mm - 32”/80 cm circular recommended Size 2 - US 7/4.5 mm - 32”/80 cm circular recommended
NOTIONS Tapestry needle, locking stitch marker (2), row counter (optional)
GAUGE Size 1 - 19 sts & 30 to 40 rows = 4”/10 cm Size 2 - 16 sts & 30 to 37 rows = 4”/10 cm Measured over stitch pattern, after blocking. Row gauge is offered as a range, since how hard you block this stitch pattern, will determine how much the stitch pattern opens up.

I combined my favorite attributes - texture, faux seams, drop shoulder, and some positive ease to create this versatile, flattering sweater! No matter your body type, it is perfect for wearing to the office or out on your weekend hike in the woods.

Pattern accessibility There are two versions of this pattern pdf available. Print, and low vision.

Musselburgh The original swatchless hat pattern: a double-layered beanie with 4-point crown shaping. The multi-gauge pattern now includes 9 gauges, for yarn weights between light fingering and DK, and 6 sizes.
Have a single skein of yarn you’re not sure what to do with? Need something simple to keep your hands busy during zoom meetings? Looking for a gift that everyone will appreciate? Want to cast on right away without any prep? Cast on today, no swatching required, and discover for yourself why so many knitters have fallen in love with Musselburgh.
In what is essentially a three step project you’ll start with a centre-out cast-on and increase for the first crown; the next part is a beautifully meditative knit (perfect for those zoom calls!) of stockinette in the round; finally, you will finish off the hat by mirroring the initial shaping with decreases. This simple canvas is perfect for exploring your creativity through yarn choice, stripes or colour blocking. The hat is fully reversible, so working each half in a different colour or stripe sequence can turn it into two completely different hats in one.

This short row shawl looks lovely in either a long transition mutli-colorway or in placed color OR with bits and pieces from your STASH.
Instructions are expressed in a new and unique method which I developed and that most American knitters are familiar with. The instructions let you know when you are on the right side or wrong side and gives extensive stitch counts. For some, it takes away a lot of the confusion sometimes found in other expressions of short rows.
There is a lot of counting and this is very important. It is not a great project to knit while only partially focused in the short row sections. But there is also a lot of plain, garter knitting employed. For every short row section, there are rows in between that are more simple to execute.
A few pattern notes: Pre-reading of this pattern can cause confusion. If it does not make sense when doing this, try casting on and only reading a bit ahead to see if it starts to make sense as you work.
Yarn Choice: This shawl is knit in FINGERING WEIGHT yarn. The first two shawls I made had 2 ‘long transition’ multi colored yarns (knit picks Chroma Fingering).
I made the initial 6 color shawl to help show where colors were being used for the ease of reading the pattern.
For color and yarn ideas, use the Ravelry system for yarns used for this pattern, it is GREAT!

Choosing the size to knit: This sweater has optional bust shaping. The three options correspond to a B, D, and F cup. To determine which size to knit, you will want to take your full bust measurement and your “high bust” measurement (this is the circumference of your body at the armhole). If you’ve never done these measurements before, this blog post may be helpful:
https://paprikapatterns.com/when-do-you-need-a-full-bust-...
If “full bust measurement - high bust measurement” is less than 5 cm/2 inches, follow the B cup instructions. between 5 cm/2 inches and 10 cm/4 inches, follow the D cup instructions. between 10 cm/4 inches and 15 cm/6 inches, follow the F cup instructions.
For those following the D and F cup options, you will add extra stitches for the front in the front raglans and work a vertical dart in the body to remove those additional stitches.
If the sizing/cup options are confusing, feel free to email me at the email in the pattern for guidance on selecting a size.

The Salty Days Sweater got its name from the salt fields in Portugal - the different sections of textures look a bit like the intricate patterns of salt flakes. The sweater is worked top down and has a dropped shoulder with extra-long sleeves for a feminine and cozy look.
The work begins by shaping the back yoke flat while increasing for the shoulder seams, then stitches are picked up from the right and left shoulder for the front yoke. The front and back yokes are then joined together and worked in the round for the body. Stitches are picked up for the sleeves and worked in the round, and lastly stitches are picked up for the double folded collar.
The sweater is worked on 5 mm (US8) needles with one strand of merino together with one strand of silk mohair, or in a DK weight yarn. The collar, hem and cuff ribs are worked in twisted rib on 3 mm (US2.25) needles.
Sizes: XS (S, M, L, XL) (2XL, 3XL, 4XL, 5XL)
Finished garment measurements: Finished bust circumference: 100 (112, 123.5, 135.5, 147) (155.5, 173, 189.5, 197.5) cm / 40 (44.75, 49.5, 54, 58.75) (62, 69.25, 75.75, 79)”. Length from underarm to hem: 37 (37, 37, 39, 39) (40.5, 40.5, 40.5, 42) cm / 14.5 (14.5, 14.5, 15.5, 15.5) (16, 16, 16, 16.75) “ Sleeve length from underarm: 47 cm / 18.5” all sizes. Upper sleeve circumference: 35.5 (40.5, 40.5, 40.5, 40.5) (40.5, 46, 46, 46) cm / 14 (16, 16, 16, 16) (16, 18, 18, 18) ”.

Choose a size that is 15-20 cm / 6-8” bigger than your bust circumference for a relaxed and slightly oversized look, this will also allow the fabric to drape beautifully. Tip! If you’re between two sizes, I recommend choosing the bigger size.
Sample in size S, Kika has a bust of approx. 87 cm / 34.25”.
Gauge: 17 sts x 24 rows/rnds = 10 cm / 4” in 1 x 2 rib st on 5 mm (US8) needles, after blocking. 19 sts x 25 rows/rnds = 10 cm/ 4” in 1 x 2 rib st on 5 mm (US8) needles, before blocking.

Needles: 3 mm (US2.5) circular needle 40-60 cm / 16-24” for neck opening and 80-100 cm / 32-40” for hem rib, and DPNs for sleeve rib (or use magic loop technique instead). 5 mm (US8) circular needle 40-60 cm / 16-24” for sleeves and 80-100 cm / 32-40” for body, or just a 80-100 cm / 32-40” needle if you’re using magic loop technique.

The sweater is worked by holding one strand of merino and one strand of silk mohair together.
Note! You can also work the sweater without a strand of silk mohair and instead only use one strand of DK or Worsted/ Medium weight yarn. Just remember to make a sample swatch before you begin to check that you have the same gauge that the pattern calls for to ensure you get the correct measurements for your garment.

First the back yoke is worked. After this, stitches are picked up and knitted for the shoulders, which are then joined to form the front yoke. The front and back yoke are joined to form the body, which is worked straight down in the round. Rib edges are worked along the neck edge and armholes. Knit a swatch to determine which needle size you need to achieve the correct gauge – note that this can vary from yarn to yarn. Take care to wash the swatch before measuring, as the texture pattern can grow with wash.
Size guide The Moby Slipover is designed to have approx. 10-15 cm [4-6 inches] of positive ease, meaning it is designed to be approx. 10-15 cm [4-6 inches] larger in circumference than your bust measurement. The sizes XS (S) M (L) XL (2XL) 3XL (4XL) 5XL are designed to fit a bust circumference of 80-85 (85-90) 90-95 (95-100) 100-110 (110-120) 120-130 (130-140) 140-150 cm [30½-33½ (33½-35½) 35½-37½ (37½-39½) 39½-43¼ (43¼-47¼) 47¼-51¼ (51¼-55) 55-59 inches]. The measurements for the finished garment are given on the first page of the pattern. Before beginning your project, measure yourself to determine which size will fit you the best. For example, if you measure 90 cm [35½ inches] around your bust (or around the widest part on your upper body) you should knit a size S. A size S slipover has a bust circumference of 102 cm [40¼ inches] which in the given example would give you 12 cm [4¾ inches] of positive ease.

DETAILS I love having patterns that I can return to time and again. Those special designs that work as a blank canvas so that you can add your own special touches - handspun yarn, stripes, fading, using up odds and ends to create ever-changing, unique knits. A pattern you can relax into as you knit it again and again. For me - that is the DRK Everyday Cowl, with its soothing garter stitch and polished slip stitches and I-cord edges. I’ve already knit 5 myself, and have no plans of stopping anytime soon!
This cowl is knit flat, on the bias, and seamed at the back neck to create a cowl that wears like a triangle shawl (with none of the fuss!) This pattern includes sizes for the whole family!
BONUS As mentioned above, I’ve knit quite a few of these - including a couple faded versions. I thought it would be fun to include my fading notes, as a fun bonus for you in the pattern itself! I created my fades by diving into my stash for fingering weight yarn that I held double for a marled fade! You can check out my project page here!

SUGGESTED YARN For this cowl I chose a DK weight yarn, as that tends to be a common yarn weight we have kicking around in our stash, but also because we can hold 2 strands of fingering weight yarn to easily achieve the same weight! I chose to use Ritual Dyes Marona (3-ply/100% Cormo) & The Farmer’s Daughter Fibers Pishkun (2-ply/100% Rambouillet) for the pattern samples, and both turned out so lovely and squishy, with fantastic stitch definition!

White Mountains Light is sport to DK weight yarn version of White Mountains which is originally designed for worsted weight yarn. It is a simple yet unique raglan sweater. I borrowed the name from Lefka Ori, white mountains in Greece.
The neckline comes with 2 variations, so that you can knit your personal sweater. You can choose crow neck or boat neck. Boat neck pattern may be beginner-friendly, because you don’t work short rows.
The sweater is worked from the top down seamlessly. The deep raglan and slightly oversized body contribute to its relaxed silhouette. The top of the sleeves form triangles, and the raglan lines flowing from the top vertex draw curves thanks to body and sleeve increases worked at different rates. The underside of sleeves also curves with decreases worked at short intervals in the upper portion. The lower portion is, on the contrary, knitted straight, which allows you to easily adjust the lengths. Anyway, take advantage of the top-down construction and try on your sweater in progress to adjust the body and sleeve lengths to your liking.
The sweater can be worked in various types of yarn. It can be great in summer yarn with elbow-length sleeves, or in lace weight yarn to enjoy transparency. I hope you enjoy knitting this sweater with your favorite yarn!

このパターンにはクルーネックとボートネックの編み方を載せました. ボートネックは前後差のない形です. 引き返し編みを使わずに編めるので初心者さんにも挑戦しやすいかと思います.
トップダウンで編むとじはぎの無いセーターです. 袖下の位置を低めに, 身頃はややオーバーサイズにして, ゆったりとしたシルエットに仕上げました. このセーターはラグランスリーブの肩が三角形になっています. 三角の頂点から始まるラグランのラインがカーブを描くように袖と身頃の増し目の位置をずらしました. 袖は前半に袖の上部で短い間隔で減らし目をして脇下に緩やかなカーブを作り, 後半は袖先に向かって減らし目なしで真っ直ぐ編む形になっています. 袖の先に減らし目がないので長さのアレンジがしやすいかと思います. トップダウンで編むセーターなので, 途中で試着をしながら着丈と袖丈をお好みの長さに調節して下さい.
色々なタイプの毛糸で編めるセーターになればと思っています. 夏糸で5分袖にアレンジしたり, 細い糸で透ける編み地で仕上げるのも素敵かと思います. お好みの糸で楽しく編んでいただけると嬉しいです.

First a section for the back of the neck is worked in double knitting, which will connect to the front edges, and form the integrated button bands. Next, stitches are picked up and knitted along the edge of this section, and the back yoke is worked from these. After this, the right and left front yoke are worked flat, separately. The three parts of the yoke are joined to form the body, which is worked flat, back and forth in brioche stitch while the front edges or button bands are continued to be worked simultaneously in double knitting. Buttonholes are worked along the double knitting front bands. Stitches are then picked up and knitted along the armholes and the sleeves are worked down from these in the round.
Begin by knitting a swatch before you start your project, to determine which needle size you need to achieve the correct gauge. Please be aware that the row gauge (i.e. how many rows there are height-wise in 10 cm [4 inches] in a column) can vary depending on the yarn you’re knitting with. The most important thing is to have the correct stitch gauge (i.e. how many stitches there are width-wise in 10 cm [4 inches]).
You can find videos of the brioche stitch and double knitting techniques at www.petiteknit.com.
Size guide The Agnete Cardigan is designed to have approx. 10-15 cm [4-6 inches] of positive ease, meaning it is designed to be approx. 10-15 cm [4-6 inches] larger in circumference than your bust measurement. The sizes XS (S) M (L) XL (2XL) 3XL (4XL) 5XL are designed to fit a bust circumference of 80-85 (85-90) 90-95 (95-100) 100-110 (110-120) 120-130 (130-140) 140-150 cm [31½-33½ (33½-35½) 35½-37½ (37½-39½) 39½-43¼ (43¼-47¼) 47¼-51¼ (51¼-55) 55-59 inches]. The measurements for the finished cardigan can be found on the front page of the pattern. Measure yourself before beginning your project, to determine which size will fit you the best. For example, if you measure 90 cm [35½ inches] around your bust (or around the widest part of your upper body) you should knit a size S. A size S sweater has a bust circumference of 105 cm [41¼ inches] which in the given example would give you 15 cm [5¾ inches] of positive ease.

As implied by the name “Hitofude”, meaning a single brush stroke in Japanese, this open front cardigan with an allover lace pattern is worked in one “yarn stroke” -- a continuous strand without cutting the yarn.
The yarn stroke starts from the upper body and sleeves worked together in a rectangular piece, then moves to lower body, where the lace pattern increases evenly, creating a gentle drape.

Fair Isle Mitten MKALendar on adventtikalenterimainen ohje kirjoneuleisiin käsiasusteisiin. Ohjeessa on neljä kokoa (XS–L), kolme tyyliä (kämmekkäät, tavalliset lapaset tai läppälapaset) ja kaksi reunusvaihtoehtoa sekä rannekkeeseen että läppälapasten läppään. Lapasten kärkikavennukset ja jälkijättöiset peukalot tehdään kirjoneuleena kun taas kämmekkäissä on kierrettyä joustinta.
Jokaiselle päivälle on oma Fair Isle -tyylinen kirjoneulekaavionsa. Kaikki kaaviot voi neuloa vain kahdella värillä mutta värejä voi käyttää niin paljon haluaa. Kuvioissa on pääosin lyhyitä langanjuoksuja ja kullakin kerroksella tarvitsee käyttää vain kahta lankaa kerrallaan. Ohjeessa on lisäksi vinkkejä ja esimerkkejä omien väriyhdistelmien laatimiseen.
Ohjeeseen sopivat kaikenlaiset fingering-vahvuiset jämälangat, vajaat kerät, lankamaistiaiset, minivyyhdit tai lankajoulukalenterit. Kirjoneulekuviot on esitetty vain ruutupiirroksina.
Fair Isle Mitten MKALendar julkaistiin alun perin mysteeriyhteisneulontana joulukuussa 2024.

Garter stitch. It‘s simple, its warm and squishy, stretchy and reversible and it makes any variegated, hand-dyed sockyarn really shine. So here‘s Hitchhiker: It is a narrow, slightly asymmetrically shaped triangular shawlette that can be wrapped around the neck several times. The ends are long enough to tie it with a knot. One of the short sides of the triangle features a saw-tooth border that evolves naturally during the knitting and gives the shawl its unusual shape. Because the knitting starts at one end, you can stop anytime, bind off and end up with a useful neckerchief, shawlette or shawl. A perfect project to relax in between more complicated ones, also very suitable for beginners and young knitters.
The name? Well, if you use a 150 g skein of Wollmeise 100% Merino for this, you can make how many teeth? That‘s right, 42. The answer to the question about the universe and everything, according to Douglas Adams‘ wonderful book „The Hitchhiker‘s Guide to the Galaxy“. So don‘t forget your towel, and happy knitting!

Kraus rechts: Einfach, warm, elastisch, von beiden Seiten hübsch anzusehen und die beste Art, ein buntes Sockengarn groß rauszubringen. Darum darf ich vorstellen: Hitchhiker. Ein langes flaches Dreieckstuch, das man mehrmals um den Hals wickeln und mit einem Knoten befestigen kann, wenn man möchte. Eine der kürzeren Dreiecksseiten hat eine witzige Zackenkante, die ganz natürlich während des Strickens entsteht und dem Tuch seine ungewöhnliche Form verleiht. Weil man an einer Ecke des Tuchs beginnt, kann man jederzeit mit dem Stricken aufhören und abketten – und bekommt ein Halstüchlein, ein kleines oder größeres Tuch. Das perfekte Strickprojekt, um zwischen komplizierteren zu entspannen. Auch geeignet für Anfänger und junge Strickerinnen und Stricker.

•••••••••••••••••••••• Du point mousse. C’est simple, c’est chaud et moelleux, élastique et réversible. Un point qui met en valeur les fils à chaussettes multicolores ou teints à la main. Hitchhiker c’est un petit châle triangulaire peu pronfond, légèrement asymétrique, que vous pouvez enrouler autour de votre cou plusieurs fois. Les pointes sont suffisamment longues pour être nouées. La bordure en dents de scie se construit tout simplement au cours du tricot et donne à ce châle son allure originale. Parce que le tricot débute par l’une des pointes latérales, vous pouvez l’achever à votre convenance, rabattre les mailles et avoir un tour de cou, un petit ou un grand châle.Voici donc un projet parfait pour se détendre entre deux ouvrages plus élaborés ou bien pour les débutants, les jeunes tricoteurs. D’où vient le nom de ce patron? Si vous utilisez un écheveau de 150 grammes, 100% mérinos de chez Wollmeise, combien de dents pourrez vous tricoter ? Vous pourrez en tricoter 42. Et 42 c’est la réponse à la question concernant l’univers et tout le reste, selon le savoureux livre de Douglas Adams « Hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy ». Alors, n’oubliez pas votre serviette et bon tricot!

Punto musgo. Es sencillo, abrigado y amoroso. Cede y es reversible y hace que cualquier lana variegada teñida a mano para calcetines resulte realmente espectacular. Así es que aquí está Hitchhiker: Es un pequeño echarpe triangular, estrecho y ligeramente asimétrico, que puede envolverse varias veces alrededor del cuello. Las puntas son lo suficientemente largas como para anudarlas. Uno de los lados cortos del triángulo muestra un borde de diente de sierra que aparece de manera natural al tejer la prenda y le da al echarpe su forma inusual. Como la prenda se trabaja empezando en un extremo, puedes darla por terminada cuando quieras, cerrando los puntos, y te encontrarás con un pañuelo de cuello, un echarpe pequeño o uno grande. Es una labor perfecta para relajarse entre otras más complicadas. También resulta muy recomendable para principiantes y niños.

••••••••••••••••••••••••••• Rätstickning. Det är enkelt, det är varmt och kramvänligt, elastiskt och vändbart och det får vilket flerfärgat, handfärgat sockgarn som helst att briljera. Så, här är Hitchhiker: Den är en grund och något asymmetriskt triangelformad liten sjal som kan viras flera gånger runt halsen. Ändarna är tillräckligt långa för att kunna knytas ihop. En av triangelns kortsidor har en sågtandad kant som växer fram på ett naturligt sätt under stickandets gång och ger sjalen dess ovanliga form. Eftersom stickningen påbörjas i ena änden så kan du avsluta när som helst, maska av och få en användbar snusnäsduk, liten sjal eller större sjal. Ett perfekt projekt att koppla av med mellan mer komplicerade projekt, och passar mycket bra även för nybörjare och yngre stickerskor och stickare.

•••••••••••••••••••••• “Автостопщик” - узкая, слегка асимметричная, удлинённая треугольная шаль, которая легко ляжет в несколько оборотов вокруг шеи. На одной из коротких сторон в процессе вязания образуется интересный зубчатый край. Петли считать не нужно! Работу можно завершить в любой момент, связав маленький галстук, небольшую шальку или большую шаль. Модель названа по научно-фантастическому роману Дугласа Адамса “Автостопом по галактике”.

••••••••••••••••• Ribbelsteek. ‘t Is eenvoudig, het is warm en elastisch, het ziet er aan beide zijden goed uit en zorg ervoor dat handgevormde sokkenwol in verloopkleuren goed tot zijn recht komt. Hitchhiker: het is en lange, smalle, enigszins asymmetrische sjaal die je meerdere malen omje nek kan wikkelen en, als je wilt, nog aan elkaar kan knopen. Een van de korte zijden van de driehoek heeft een getande rand de tijdens het breien heel natuurlijk onstaat. Hierdoor krijgt de sjaal haar bijzonderer vorm. Omdat je op een hoek van de driehoek begint, kun je elk moment ophouden met brei een en afkanten; je kunt kiezen voor een halssjaaltje of een kleinere of grotere sjaal. Een prima project om mee te ontspannen tussen meer ingewikkelde breiwerken door; ook erg geschikt voor beginners en jonge breiers.

This small scarf-like shawl is worked sideways in rows starting and ending at a narrow tip. The shawl is worked in garter stitch. Needed skills are therefore basically knitting a stitch, knitting two stitches together, and slipping stitches. The edges are worked as i-cords. The shawl can be made from only one skein of yarn. The pattern allows for easy adaptation to knit it longer, shorter, wider or narrower from any desired amount of yarn
The sample size is knitted from one skein of DK weight blue Bluefaced Leicester yarn and measures 140 x 24 cm but the pattern can be adapted to various sizes, yarn weight, color depending on personal preferences.

First the back of the yoke is worked, then the shoulders, then the front of the yoke and finally the body. Rib edges are worked along the V-neck and along the armholes. The neck edge is worked with decorative decreases mid front. Knit a swatch before beginning the project to check if the recommended needle size gives you the correct gauge. Note, that broken rib stretches when washed and with wear. The gauge you can expect to have before wash/wear is approx. 24-25 sts pr. 10 cm [4 inches], which after wash/wear will grow to the correct gauge of 22 sts pr. 10 cm [4 inches]. The most important element in achieving the correct shoulder width and fit is knitting at the correct gauge, so be sure to wash your swatch before measuring the gauge.
Size guide Friday Slipover V-neck is designed to have approx. 6 cm [2¼ inches] of positive ease, meaning it is designed to be 6 cm [2¼ inches] larger in circumference than your chest measurement.

Before beginning your project, measure yourself with a measuring tape around your bust to determine which size will fit you the best. For example, if you measure 90 cm [35½ inches/] around your bust (or the widest place on your body) you should knit a size S. A size S sweater has a chest circumference of 96 cm [37¾ inches].

If “full bust measurement - high bust measurement” is less than 5 cm/2 inches, follow the B cup instructions. between 5 cm/2 inches and 10 cm/4 inches, follow the D cup instructions. between 10 cm/4 inches and 15 cm/6 inches, follow the F cup instructions.
For those following the D and F cup options, you will work a vertical dart in the body to add stitches and decrease these additional stitches at the armhole edges in the upper body.
Gauge and modifications: DK: 17 stitches and 27 rows in stockinette = 10cm/4 inches 4 Ply: 24 stitches and 32 rows in stockinette = 10cm/4 inches
You may want to use a different stitch (e.g., a lace repeat) for your modifications. If you do so, it should meet the same gauge as the stockinette.
DK Needles: 5mm needles or needle required to get gauge, 1 needle size smaller for ribbing and/or icords. 4ply Needles: 3.5mm needles or needle required to get gauge, 1 needle size smaller for ribbing and/or icords.
Yarn A variety of yarns were used for the samples. These include Drops Belle, Sandnes Garn Line, Woolyknit Cotton held double for the DK-weight pattern, and Sandnes Garn Tynn Line, Knitting for Olive Cotton Merino, and Knitting for Olive Pure Silk for the fingering-weight options.

Alex Hood can be worn with the hood down just like a regular scarf or, on extra cold days, with the hood pulled up to protect the head and face against the wind and weather.
You start by working the first half of the scarf from one tip to the midpoint of the finished scarf before working the second half from the other tip to the midpoint. You then graft the two pieces together at midback and pick up stitches for the hood.

I am not over Granny squares. My love for them is still full blown. It’s so deeply rooted that granny squares have become my new sock project. The project that is always sitting in a basket beside my knitting nook ready to be grabbed at any moment for a few quick stitches. This cardigan is my ode to my favourite colour palette done up in my current favourite Granny Squares. A match made in heaven.
Sizes 1 (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) Approximate finished chest: 87.5 (107.5, 124.5, 150.5, 175.5, 200) cm / 34.5 (42.25, 49, 59.25, 69, 78.75)”
Notes on sizing: The sizes given are the actual finished full chest measurement of the garment, choose a size that corresponds to 30-43 cm / 12-17” larger than your upper bust measurement or, the size that will give you the amount of ease you like. There are larger than I’m used to jumps between the sizes due to the restrictions imposed by the fixed sizes of the squares and I think that it suits the casual nature of the pattern. It is not intended to be fitted, there is no shoulder shaping, it’s a throw it on and run out the door kinda cardi. Because this is an open front cardigan where the back width is greater than the width of the front (the fronts don’t meet when the cardigan is laid flat, but it can be buttoned which will create a slightly raised front hem) the sizes are based on the back width. I recommend wearing this drop shoulder style with a lot of positive ease. I am wearing the size 3 with close to 43 cm / 17” of positive ease. My daughter is wearing the size 1 with 38 cm / 15” of positive ease. When worn buttoned the circumference is decreased by about 5 cm / 2” as the fronts have to pull together to fasten. Crochet is different from knitting in that it’s denser and heavier, it doesn’t have the same fluid drape that knit fabric can have. Keep this in mind when choosing your size. My vision for the fit is to have a generously proportioned body and the crisp ribbing and slightly slimmer sleeves keep it from looking sloppy.
Gauge 22 stitches and 28 rows = 10 cm / 4” square in stockinette stitch knit in the round on larger needles after wet blocking. Each Granny square should measure 9 (10.75, 12.75, 10.75, 12.75, 14.5) cm / 3.5 (4.25, 5, 4.25, 5, 5.75)” with joining round.
Recommended Needles Size F 3.75mm crochet hook. 3.5mm (US size 4) 32” or longer circular needle for ribbing. 4 mm (US size 6) needle in your preferred needle style for working small circumference in the round for the sleeves.
Yarn Tanis Fiber Arts PureWash DK (113g = 260 yds). Approximate Yardage: DK: 675 (820, 980, 1480, 1520, 1650) yds for granny squares plus 250 (300, 360, 410, 460, 500) yds of MC for the sleeves and ribbing.
Note: The joining round, which is shown here in the MC, is included in the yardage for the granny squares. If you are planning multicoloured granny squares with the joining round worked in your MC like my samples, approximately 230 (250, 275, 450, 360, 400) yds of your “granny square” yardage will be in your MC - so you’ll need to factor that into your MC yardage requirements.
I used lots and lots of odds and ends of leftover skeins of yarns for my granny squares and then Chris Grey for the MC.
For my daughter’s cardigan I used the Mini Skein set from our Star Blanket kits and a OOAK for the MC.
Additional Tools and Materials Tapestry needle, 5 removable stitch markers. Five, 1 cm / 0.5” buttons.

The Love Letter Top is a tribute to lace stitch patterns - a love letter written by a pair of knitting needles in the shape of a knitted fabric. The design was born from a desire to create something with an all over lace motif that keeps changing all the time. It’s a true celebration of the textures and intricate shapes that we can create with our knitting needles.
The top is worked top down, first the upper back and front are worked back and forth, and then the body is worked in the round. Lastly stitches are picked up around the neckline and armholes for an i-cord bindoff edge.

After over 7000 Ravelry projects completed since publishing this hat in January 2008, I’m revising the pattern August 2015 as follows.
1) The pattern is now available in the Ravelry pattern store so it’s easier to get and you don’t need to rely on the old PDF link from a hackable Wordpress blog.
2) There were some complaints from a few people that they couldn’t get the leaves to stand up and twist, so I’ve made that section clearer, and tested it with someone who had never made the hat before.
3) There’s now a chart for the leaf section including the color strand section and the decreases to form the twisted leaves. There are still written instructions as well, and I think they’re clearer, too.
4) General instructions for adapting for a toddler or child size are included.
5) I welcome translations (the previous pattern was translated into 5 languages) and a magic loop mod. If you’d like to share these, please message me and I’ll incorporate these into the pattern on another revise.",https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/berry-baby-hat

Also, knitting stripes makes this one a really quick project to complete because the curiosity of seeing how every next stripe will affect the overall look is highly addictive, and a lot of fun.
The work begins by working the back flat, then stitches are picked up for the left and right front separately and worked flat. The back and front are then joined together and the body is worked in the round. Stitches are picked up for the sleeves and worked in the round and lastly stitches are picked up around the neckline and the collar is worked in a twisted rib stitch.

The Stripe Hype sweater is designed to have 20-30 cm / 8-12” of positive ease. Choose a size that is 20-30 cm / 8-12” bigger than your bust circumference for a relaxed and slightly oversized look.
Sample in size M, Kika has a bust of approx. 87 cm / 34.25” and is 171 cm/ 5’6” tall.

Notions: Removable stitch markers, tapestry needle, stitch holder or scrap yarn.
Suggested yarn:
The Stripe Hype Sweater is worked in a DK weight yarn with one main base color and 5 contrasting colors. I invite you to play around with your color choices: add even more colors for a really playful and vibrant sweater, or just go with 2-3 colors for a more toned down and classic look.
Tip! If you’ve got a lot of fingering weight yarn in your stash, hold 2 strands of fingering weight yarn double to get the DK weight.

She was at the time 95 and living in Redwood City CA, still knitting, and expressed the desire to have her pattern live on. As Christine would be 108 today, we can only hope that she’s still around, but perhaps she’s not able to see well enough to still make them. …Christine’s legacy is this pattern for booties that stay on because of the clever side ribbing, and as we all know keeping booties on babies is not a straightforward task…”
“Christine used Red Heart acrylic baby yarn or a 3-ply Wintuck but recommended trying one of the new Superwash wools as well….the many colorful sock yarns for adult which are usually superwash wool and reinforced with a bit of nylon.”

Construction The pattern has you cast on at the neckline, and work flat, utilising standard raglan increases until you reach the required chest size. From here the arm stitches are put on to waste yarn (or a stitch holder), and the body completed. You then return to the sleeves, working them in the round to length, before picking up stitches framing the body to create a ribbed edging.

Why choose a frontless cardigan? If you have ever been mama to a bub with reflux, or simply a spilly babe, you will understand how frustrating it is to keep washing the dirty fronts of cardigans and sweaters. Newborn Vertebrae is also excellent for baby wearing, and getting in some skin to skin cuddles with your newborn.

Baby Vertebrae, Kiddy Vertebrae, and Mama Vertebrae So you’ve enjoyed knitting the Newborn Vertebrae, but your baby is getting too big to squeeze in any longer? Newborn Vertebrae comes in comprehensive patterns: Baby Vertebrae - newborn to 2 years, and 3 yarn weights (fingering, dk, and worsted) Kiddy Vertebrae - 12 months to 10 years, and 5 yarn weights (fingering, dk, light worsted, aran, bulky) Mama Vertebrae - 72.5cm - 102.5cm upper chest circumference, and 4 yarn weights (fingering, dk, worsted, aran)",https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/newborn-vertebrae

These are some of my favorite projects to make. Special, unique, and perfect for using treasured skeins and making gifts. Venezia is a precious, delicate shawlette, perfect for any single skein of fingering weight yarn. Worked from tip to tip, with a reversible lace pattern and a diamond shape. It is framed by a gorgeous reversible diamond lace motif, and the main body of the shawl is worked in ribbing.

Errata from Joji’s Website (Sept 1 2020) Rows 20-24: Sl1, k4, work Diamond, k5.

Common question about slipping the first stitch of the row: You can do it knitwise or purlwise, whatever you like best! As long as you keep consistent throughout the shawl. My preference: Knitwise with yarn in back.
FINISHED MEASUREMENTS 76½“ (184 cm) long and 16¾ (42 cm) wide at middle point.
MATERIALS Yarn: 1 skein of Merino Singles by Uschitita (100% Merino; 400y/366m; 100g) or approx. 400y (366m) of fingering weight yarn. The sample was made using colorway Venezia. This shawl is designed to use up a full skein of yarn in fingering weight, but it can be made using a thicker weight yarn or a skein with more yardage… I recommend you weigh your yarn before starting your work. At the end of section 3 you should have used slightly under 50% of your total grams, to be sure you can finish the whole pattern. Needles: US 7 (4.5 mm) needles.

My goal for the GARDEN cardigan was an open front cardigan with built in button bands that stays on the shoulders while working in the garden, with a nice neckline to keep your neck warm and a super easy to knit lace texture for a lightweight fabric. And yes, it has a hidden pocket on the inside :)
GARDEN Cardigan is worked seamlessly from the top down. You start working the back for the length of the armhole. Then you pick up the stitches for the front and work both fronts symmetrically for the length of the armhole. Then you join back and fronts to work the body in stitch pattern down to the bottom ribbing. Pick up the sleeve sts to work the sleeves both alike top down in rounds in stitch pattern. Optional attach the patch pocket. Beside of weaving in the ends, there is no further finishing required.

Decreases help shape to fit the shoulders and neck. A purl column on each side gives the illusion of a seam.
I recommend using a yarn that will hold its shape. The Lion Brand acrylic and wool yarn works beautifully. A merino or cashmere would also be lovely. However, superwash yarn grows so it may not be the best choice.

You’ll also need…

US 10 (6.0 mm), 16-inch circular needles (Note: Always use the needles that you need to get the correct gauge. In this case, some of our sample makers found a US 10 worked better for them than what Plenty’s label recommends, which is a US 9 for 4 stitches to the inch. If you know you’re a bit of a tight knitter, US 10 needles are more likely to work for you, and if you’re on the loose side, you may prefer a US 9s!)

A deviation from the classic vest - boxy, funky and relaxed; Milo is designed to keep the torso warm while letting those busy arms run free and unhindered.
Milo is the perfect introductory knit for those new to circular knitting. They also make terrific knits for gifts - no baby should be without a milo.
Construction: Milo is knit entirely in the round from the top down. Increases are used to shape the mitred bodice, with a simple cable gracing the front of the vest.
Six different cable options are included to help you create a little milo all of your own.
Cable patterns are in both written and chart form.
Sizing: For best fit choose size based on actual chest measurement rather than age. To fit actual chest measurement of: 15-20: 15/38 (16/40.5, 17/43, 18/45.5) [19/48, 20/51] 21-25: 21/53.5 (22/56, 23/58.5, 24/61, 25/63.5) inches/cms

This vest is designed to be slim fitting in style with little to no ease.

When substituting yarn, this pattern is very forgiving and works with pretty much any yarn that will knit to a standard DK/8ply tension. A wool-based yarn is recommended to provide some elasticity and memory through the yoke section.
You may wish to substitute the cable stitch pattern in the larger sizes to replicate the aesthetic of the smaller size. Some tips for doing so can be found here

The slipover has a deep armhole and is closed with two buttons along both sides. First, the back is worked and then the front. Ribbing edges are worked along the armholes, and along the sides, which form slits towards the hem, double knitted edges are worked. Two buttonholes are worked along the front part of these double knitted edges. At the end, a ribbing edge is worked along the neck opening.

The measurements for the finished garment are listed on the front page of the pattern (please note that these measurements are only achieved if the slipover is knitted in the correct gauge). If the recipient measures 57 cm [22½ inches] around the chest, you should knit a size 4-5 years. Size 4-5 years has a chest circumference of 77 cm [30¼ inches] which will, in this example, give 20 cm [7¾ inches] of positive ease. If the measured chest circumference deviates from the age guide, you can adjust the lengths to the person you’re knitting for. The same applies if the child is short/taller than average.

Contrast Color Sport to DK weight handspun yarn, fiber shown was dyed by Hello Yarn 100% Corriedale (200 yds / 183 m per 110 g) Shown in colorway All Bark, No Bite 1 skein
To substitute the Contrast Color yarn used here, I recommend using a sport to DK weight yarn with marling or color transitions to create an effect similar to handspun, or use a similarly colored fingering weight yarn held double.
Alternatively, this could be a perfect project for mini skeins (either sport or DK held singly, or fingering weight held double), using a different color mini for each 12-row section. There are 19 of these sections and there are indications to change contrast color yarn in the “Bandana Body” section of the pattern.

If substituting mini skeins with a sport or DK weight yarn, yardage will be half of what is listed above.
Gauge 19 sts and 25 rows = 4” / 10 cm in Stockinette Stitch, worked flat, unblocked
Note about Gauge This pattern uses nearly all of the listed yardage of main color yarn. To conserve your yarn for the cowl, knit a gauge swatch without cutting the yarn and measure the swatch unblocked. When you have gauge, rip back the swatch and cast on.

The settlement has been abandoned for almost a century, yet all that remains today are a few foundations, coal heaps and the stairs that once lead up to the church. Well worth a visit despite its haunting feel.
The 2 parts of this hat remind me of the 2 sections of the town; upper and lower Bankhead, where the houses existed and the industrial area thrived.

Baby Vertebrae is the comprehensive version of the free Newborn Vertebrae pattern. It is written for 3 yarn weights (4ply/fingering weight, 8ply/dk weight, and 10ply/light worsted weight), and to fit from birth (37.5cm chest) to 2years (52.5cm).
The pattern is seamlessly knit utilising the top down raglan shaping method. To knit this pattern you will need to be able to knit flat, pick up stitches, then work small diameter circular knitting to complete the sleeves (magic loop or utilising DPNs)
Why choose a frontless cardy? If you have ever been mama to a bub with reflux, a spilly babe, or even a messy eating 1year old, you will understand how frustrating it is to keep washing the dirty fronts of cardigans and sweaters. The Baby Vertebrae is also excellent for baby wearing, and getting in some skin to skin cuddles with your newborn.

This pattern was specifically designed to work with the variegation of colors, instead of getting obscured underneath the color changes. One skein of fingering weight yarn is enough to complete a shawl, and the pattern is easy to modify to compensate for slight variations in yardage.
I’ve not added a gauge, as I feel there is no one catch-all gauge for this pattern. Use needles that gives you a fabric that you like - you’ll want the fabric to drape, but not be seethrough-airy, adjust needle size if necessary. Heavier or lighter yarn weights can also be used for this pattern, though dimensions and yardage will change. Change the number of garter and mesh section rows to alter size if necessary.

First, the back yoke is worked back and forth with the shoulder slope shaped using short rows. Then, each shoulder is worked separately and joined to form the front yoke. Front and back yoke are then joined to form the body, which is worked in the round on a circular needle to the hem. The ribbed neck edge and armhole edges are worked at the end, and the latter are worked with decreases at the armhole. Begin by working a swatch to determine which needle size you need to achieve the correct gauge.
Size guide The Weekend slipover is designed to have approx. 20-25 cm [7¾-9¾ inches] of positive ease, meaning it is designed to be 20-25 cm [7¾-9¾ inches] larger in circumference than your bust measurement.

The measurements for the finished garment are on the front page of the pattern. Before beginning your project, measure yourself to determine which size to knit. For example, if you measure 90 cm [35½ inches] around your bust (or around the widest part of your upper body) you should knit a size S. A size S slipover has a bust circumference of 112 cm [44 inches], which in the given example would give you 22 cm [8½ inches] of positive ease.

Well, I have created a slightly bulkier version of this knitted beanie using Lion Brand’s Color Made Easy yarn. NOTE: this yarn is now discontinued, you can use the Yarn Substitution site online to find similar yarn to use or feel free to look through hundreds of completed projects for this pattern on this site to see what other yarns knitters have used to successfully knit up the hat with. This pattern works up to be a very comfy, cozy and warm beanie which is a great project for winter and creates a stylish hat for beanie season.
This pattern is advanced beginner friendly, requires US10 (6.0mm) circular needles and approximately 117 yards of the Color Made Easy Yarn, which the pattern has been specifically designed with and for. Light bulky weight yarns could be substituted however no other yarn has been tested with this specific pattern so the same outcome for fit cannot be assured or guaranteed.
A gauge swatch was not done prior to pattern design however, stitch guidelines have been provided within the pattern for you to monitor sizing.
The pattern has been designed to fit for average adult women but detailed additional notes are provided to assist in making a Child/pre-teen sized hat.

First, the back yoke is worked flat, back and forth, shaped with increases. Then each shoulder is worked separately, from stitches that are picked up and knitted along the top of the back yoke. Stitches are then picked up and knitted along the shoulders, and the rest of the yoke and the body is worked back and forth on the circular needle. The sleeves are worked in the round on double-pointed needles or on a long circular needle using the Magic Loop technique. At the end, plackets are worked along the front edges and along the neck.
Begin by working a swatch to determine which needle size you need to achieve the correct gauge. Wash and block the swatch before taking any measurements.
Size guide The Maggie Cardigan is designed to have approx. 5 cm [2 inches] of positive ease, meaning it is designed to be approx. 5 cm [2 inches] larger in circumference than your bust measurement. The sizes XXS (XS) S (M) L (XL) 2XL (3XL) 4XL (5XL) are designed to fit a bust circumference of 75-80 (80-85) 85-90 (90-95) 95-100 (100-110) 110-120 (120-130) 130-140 (140-150) cm [29½-31½ (31½-33½) 33½-35½ (35½-37½) 37½-39½ (39½-43¼) 43¼-47¼ (47¼-51¼) 51¼-55 (55-59) inches]. The measurements for the finished sweater can be found on the front page of the pattern. Please note that these measurements can only be achieved if the correct gauge is maintained throughout. Measure yourself before beginning your project, to determine which size will fit you the best. For example, if you measure 90 cm [35½ inches] around your bust (or around the widest part of your upper body) you should knit a size S. A size S sweater has a bust circumference of 96 cm [37¾ inches] which in the given example would give you 6 cm [2¼ inches] of positive ease.

It is started at the tip of the shawl, then increased on every right side row until the full width before decreasing your way back to the other tip. The size can easily be modified by adding more pattern repeats for a larger shawl.
The Laulu shawl was designed with those odd balls and leftover skeins of fingering weight yarn and mohair we all have in our stashes, but the shawl can also be worked in a single strand of DK weight yarn.
Laulu is the Finnish word for “a song”. I chose this name because the undulating cables and rhythm they create reminded me of soft melodies.

Yarn Note: The shawl uses a strand of fingering weight yarn held together with a strand of lace weight yarn, but they can be substituted for a single strand of DK weight yarn. If you wish to work a DK weight version, omit all the instructions where it says “hold the yarns together” and follow only the yarn amount requirements for the fingering weight yarn.

The Tunisian Simple Scarf is a fun pattern to make.This scarf is a great project to get the feel of this technique by practicing the repetitiveness of the stitch. I’ve included some increase and decrease sections to form the shape of the scarf with points and tassels on the ends.
Sample is made with a beautiful yarn from Red Heart Yarns called Colorscape. I used two skeins of the color called Shanghai.
Pattern is written in Standard American Terms. See pattern for altering the length.

SUGGESTED YARN For this cardigan I chose to hold two unique yarns together, to create a dimensional fabric that has the strength of wool with the softness of Suri alpaca! I think you could sub in a single strand of fingering weight or sport yarn, just make sure to do a gauge swatch! I used La Bien Aimée Helix - a light and lofty Falkland/Gotland wool blend that is spun up into a light fingering/lace weight yarn that has a soft halo. This grey base is overdyed in rich colors, giving it a dreamy depth! I paired it with La Bien Aimée Kumo. If you know me, you know I have a weak spot for Suri alpaca yarns. This soft and fluffy yarn creates an amazing halo that I find more comfortable next to skin than some of its fuzzy brethren. Kumo adds a bright glow when held double with Helix that I find mesmerizing!

The vest consists of a central panel (essentially a rectangle), worked in the round and featuring a botanical colourwork pattern, and four sides, worked sideways from the central panel and joined at the underarms. The edges of the body and armholes are finished with half twisted ribbing worked in the round.
Bifurcation means splitting of a larger whole into two smaller and separate units. Furca hence means a fork. Imagine a tree that splits in the middle into two smaller branches — that’s where the inspiration comes from. And since both the front and back are identical — it’s bifurca — two-forked.

First the back yoke is worked, then the shoulders, and then the front yoke are worked flat. After this, the front and back yoke are joined and the body is worked in the round, and finally rib edges are worked along the neck and armhole openings.
Begin by knitting a swatch to determine which needle size you need to achieve the correct gauge before starting the project.
Size guide Note that these measurements are only achieved if the correct gauge is kept.
The Sille slipover is designed to have approx. 6-10 cm 2¼-4 inches of positive ease, meaning it is designed to be 6-10 cm [2¼-4 inches] larger in circumference than your bust measurement. The sizes XS (S) M (L) XL (2XL) 3XL (4XL) are designed to fit a bust circumference of 80-85 (85-90) 90-95 (95-100) 100-110 (110-120) 120-130 (130-140) cm [31½-33½ (33½-35½) 35½-37½ (37½-39½) 39½-43¼ (43¼-47¼) 47¼-51¼ (51¼-55) inches].
The measurements for the finished garment are on the front page of the pattern. Before beginning your project, measure yourself to determine which size to knit. For example, if you measure 90 cm 35½ inches around your bust (or around the widest part of your upper body) you should knit a size S. A size S slipover has a bust circumference of 96 cm 37¾ inches, which in the given example would give you 6 cm [2¼ inches] of positive ease. If you would like a more oversize fit, knit a size larger.

Note! We’ve had questions about the raglan seams shifting. For the raglan seams where the increases are made on the WS on the short rows, some feel the seam shifts when changing to working in the round. The kfb/pfb increase is made in the same spot, but due to the nature of the increase, the loop that is worked first aligns more with the original stitch.",https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/lento

For pattern support, please find the questions thread here
Lillesol is worked seamlessly from the top down. The back is worked in plain Stockinette stitch while the front features a beautiful faux cable pattern panel at the center. Knitting starts with the cast-on of the shoulders for the back. Once the short row shaped shoulder slope is done, the back is worked flat to underarm. Shoulder stitches are picked up to work the front to the same length. At underarm both front and back are joined to work the body top down in rounds. Neck finishing is worked next. Sleeve stitches are picked up around the arm opening to work the sleeves (short or long) top down in rounds.
Body and sleeves can be lengthened or shortened by working more or less rounds before starting the edging. Size can be adjusted by working widthwise from the size you need/want for your chest, and lengthwise from the size you need/want for your upper arms. Upper arm circumference is determined by the armhole length plus the underarm cast-on. Work more or less rows for both fronts and back (follow instructions for a smaller/ bigger size) to adjust armhole length. Stitch counts are given after each increase or decrease row/round.

We think it’s hilarious how babies sometimes have an elderly look about them, so we created this shawl-collared grandpa sweater for your grouchy little one! Suit your little one (or big one!) up and no matter how grumpy, they will be stylish.
And YES, despite reasonable common-sense notions, babies DO require pockets to store their tiny little pipes, and patches to prevent them from wearing holes through the elbows of their cardigans after years of use! Make an adorable matching sweater for yourself too.

Knit from the bottom up and adorned with puff sleeves, this sweater will be a truly special addition to your handmade wardrobe! The body is worked in the round until the divide for the yoke.

The sleeves are then picked up from the body and knit in the round down to the cuff. Please note that the colorwork in this sweater is charted only.

This is my fourth year of hosting a blanket CAL and I am so excited to share what I have in store for you!
I love trying new stitches and techniques and I have been experimenting with Tunisian Mosaic Crochet lately. You probably already know this but I love this technique so I decided to use it for my next blanket CAL!
This is going to be a mystery CAL where one 10” x 10” square will be released every 2 weeks - at 10 AM Central Time on alternate Wednesdays. Each square will be made with a different mosaic pattern.
WHY TUNISIAN MOSAIC CROCHET I chose Tunisian Mosaic Crochet for my next CAL because of 3 reasons -

You only need to know 2 stitches
There are no color changes in the middle of a row
You don’t have a million ends to weave in!

RELEASE SCHEDULE January 4th – Square #1 January 18th – Square #2 February 1st – Square #3 February 15th – Square #4 March 1st – Square #5 March 15th – Square #6 March 29th – Square #7 April 12th – Square #8 April 26th – Square #9 May 10th – Square #10 May 24th – Square #11 June 7th – Square #12 & Square #13 June 21st – Square #14 July 5th – Square #15 July 19th – Square #16 August 2nd – Square #17 August 16th – Square #18 August 30th – Square #19 September 13th – Square #20 September 27th – Square #21 October 11th – Square #22 October 25th – Square #23 November 8th – Square #24 & Square #25 November 22nd – Join and Border

TECHNIQUE AND DIFFICULTY Squares – Beginner The squares in this blanket are beginner friendly. There are only two stitches you need to know.
Border – Intermediate The border in this blanket will be worked in a round. If you are not comfortable with working in a round, you can skip the mosaic border and make any border of your choice.
SIZE Each square measures 10” (25.5 cms). My mosaic border is 3.25” (8 cms) wide and the size of my blanket is 57” x 57”.
GAUGE 8 rows of 8 stitches is a 2” square. The gauge swatch is worked with a mosaic pattern which is mentioned in the document.
YARN I made my blanket with Stylecraft Special DK yarn in colors Silver and White.

NOTES AND TECHNIQUES
Luminos Tee is knitted from the bottom with an alternative garter tab cast-on. Increases are made (similar to shawl knitting) until the folded triangle reaches half the width of the tee. A second similar piece is made and both pieces make the bottom wedges of the tee. In smaller sizes, 2 chevrons join the pieces in the round until the underarm length is reached. The chevrons are divided to be worked straight separately for the front and the back until the armhole depth is reached. In larger sizes, the bottom wedges are divided for front and back, then each piece is joined with a chevron to be worked separately with armhole shaping until the armhole depth is reached. The front and back shoulders are joined for decreases in the round until the neck width is reached. 2x2 ribbing completes the v-neck. Shoulder details are added using surface chain stitches, and armhole finishing is completed using the same strand of yarn from the surface chain.
As the neck band is knitted continuously from the shoulders instead of being knitted after picking up stitches creating a “seam”, the tee is seamless and totally reversible. If you weave in ends neatly on the inside, it is reversible inside / outside. You can enjoy a different look with the reverse stockinette side. If you use a variegated yarn that creates a diffetent look on the front and back, or if you get creative making your own stripe patterns that are different on the front and back, the tee is reversible front / back.
Have fun creating colour combinations, paring a main yarn with your special single skein of yarn.

This afghan is knit in four sections and seamed together. Each of the four pieces begins at one corner, and mitered squares are picked up and knit directly onto the existing work.
Please be aware that if using skeins of Brava with 273 yards per skein, the yardage requirements are very exact. To make sure you do not run out, double check gauge and limit yarn tails to 6”.
Though the mitered squares are all worked the same way, they begin slightly differently depending on their place in the pattern.
Each of the four sections of the afghan begins and is worked the same way. The first square cast on becomes one of the four corners of the finished afghan, and then four more squares are picked up and knit, one after another, to form a row of squares. The next row of squares is picked up and knit onto the previous row, and so on, until the 5×5 square section is complete.

Choose four colors of fingering weight yarn in a gradient color series. Organize your colors from light to dark as you begin knitting the center square. There is also a crochet option in Section 1 of the pattern. Continue with eyelet stripes that flow into a textured zig zag slip stitch pattern. The border of this modular shawl features a dip stitch technique, which is so much fun to knit! Finish the shawl with some festive fringe and drape this wearable work of art over your shoulders.

Try to get close to the recommended stitch gauge to ensure you don’t run out of yarn. A similar stitch gauge is more important than getting an exact row gauge.
Garter Stitch Swatch If you would like to see how your colors interact, cast on 30 stitches and knit some colorful stripes, knitting on the right side and wrong side for garter stitch. I recommend striping the colors by knitting 8 rows of each color, resulting in 4 garter ridges for each stripe like this…
Knit 8 rows with color A. Knit 8 rows with color B. Knit 8 rows with color C. Knit 8 rows with color D.
Repeat those stripes again to see your A, B, C, D striping effect and check your stitch gauge

NOTES
Construction This vest is worked seamlessly from the top down. It starts by casting on stitches for the upper back, and working flat down to the underarm. You will then put those stitches on hold, and pick up separate stitches for the front shoulders to then shape the neckline. Next you will continue the front down to match the back, and then join in the round to work the body. Once the body is finished, stitches will be picked up for the neckline and armholes to work the ribbed edges in the round.",https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/see-my-vest---chunky

Choose from the NEW V-Neck or go with the original round neck
Will you go for the NEW waist shaping option for the body?
Which hem will you pick - to split or not to split? ;)

Now that you have all the options - which will you choose?
The pattern comes in two files - the original round neck version and the NEW V-neck, waist shaping and hem options file.

Riptide Slipover is a cropped tank or slipover with a cute, simple, lace textured central panel in the front and back. The armhole bands run seamlessly into the side broken rib panels to the front split hem.
CONSTRUCTION NOTES: Riptide Slipover is worked in one piece, from the top down. Commencing with the back, the neck and shoulders are knit and shaped in one piece and worked flat to the underarm. Front shoulder stitches are then picked up from the back cast on edge and the front is worked flat to same back length. At underarm, extra stitches are cast on and the front and back are joined for working in the round. The body can be worked straight or there is a waist shaping option, to the hem, where there is a further option working a split or non-split hem in broken rib. The neckband may be worked at any point after the upper front is complete. Experience Level: Intermediate
Front V-Neck Increases The front V-neck edges are worked using a combination of increases before and during armhole shaping. There are two stitch patterns for each the Left and the Right V-neck edge. Follow the instructions for your chosen size. Charts for these stitch patterns are available.
Gauge and summer tank styling The slipover is designed with a deep armhole, so please note that the row gauge is important if you plan to wear it as a summer tank. If the row gauge is less than 33 rows, the armhole will be deeper. If the row gauge is more than 33 rows, the armhole depth will be shorter.
Body length You may lengthen this garment by knitting more body length before commencing the hem. Try on as you go and adjust accordingly. Note that extra yarn will be required if you knit the body length longer. See last photo.

Starting with a split bottom hem worked flat, the body is joined to work in the round up to the sleeve split. The fronts and backs are worked flat, with neckline and shoulder shaping. Shoulders are joined, then stitches are picked up to knit your preferred sleeve option, then finally neckline stitches are picked up.
This pattern is designed to be worked in different yarn weights from DK to aran/bulky. This is a great opportunity to stash dive and play with different yarn combinations to create an interesting and unique fabric. The yarn you choose will change the fabric of your final garment- bulkier yarn or yarn held double will create a thicker fabric while a thinner yarn will create an airier, more open fabric. You only need to make sure to match the stitch gauge to make sure your tee will fit properly. The row gauge is less important as you can knit more or fewer rows as needed to achieve the length required. Pattern instructions are given with length measurements to make this easy to follow regardless of your row gauge.

DETAILS My hope for this cowl is to inspire you to try experimenting with gauge to play with the size of the cowl, explore different color possibilities, hold a couple strands of yarn together, or even better - spin your own yarn! The stitch pattern lends itself beautifully to a relaxing knit, but its unique construction makes it fun to knit again and again! This cowl is worked flat on the bias, and then seamed. You begin by increasing on both edges, then only one, and finally decreasing on one edge to create this unique shape!

YARN REQUIREMENTS These are just approximations. Total yarn usage will depend on the yarn you use (fiber content, ply, etc.), your personal gauge, and any modifications you may make.
DK Weight Wool Yarn Total approximate yardage per size: 65 (105, 157, 170) g/165 (265, 400, 430) yds/150 (245, 365, 395) m Exact yardage will depend on size, gauge and yarn used.
Here is an estimate in grams of yarn necessary to use a different weight yarn in this pattern. Please note that these are just estimations. I recommend staying within the range of fingering to worsted weight yarns. Fingering - 55 (85, 130, 140) g Sport - 60 (90, 140, 150) g Worsted - 70 (110, 165, 175) g
SUGGESTED YARN For this cowl I chose my handspun, as it is the perfect canvas to watch how a new yarn knits up!
Sample A (aquas, greens and purples) is 100% Rambouillet in the one of a kind colorway “Fine by Me” dyed by Hello Yarn, and was spun as a fractal 3-ply into a DK weight yarn using a short forward draft. This sample was made following the written instructions.
Sample B (browns & purples) is a blend of different fibers spun as a 3-ply combo spin and coming in as a Fingering weight yarn at 14 WPI. This sample was made by following the alternative “recipe instructions” by knitting to specific dimensions.

The world is your oyster when it comes to choosing yarn for this cowl. Any of the yarns listed for The Traveler Shawl on the pattern page! We’ve put together a PDF of ideas for you below under Yarn Substitutions! My testers had great success knitting to the dimensions in the pattern, which left them open to choose their own yarn weight and gauge to knit at. So stash dive, spin your own yarn, or finally put that coveted skein you got at the festival last year to good use! I just recommend sticking to fingering, sport, DK or worsted weight (or combining yarns to land close to one of those weights).

SUGGESTED NEEDLES US 6/4 mm - 24”/60 cm circular recommended (Use the needle size you need to achieve gauge. Cord length is not overly important, as you won’t be joining to work in the round.)
Here are the size needles I would recommend for other yarn weights. I personally prefer to knit my cowls with a bit more structure, so I opt for the smaller needle in the range. Fingering Weight - US 2-3/2.75-3.25 mm Sport Weight - US 4-5/3.5-3.75 mm Worsted Weight - US 7-8/4.5-5 mm
NOTIONS Tapestry needle, locking stitch marker (2), row counter (optional)
GAUGE 21 sts & 40 rows = 4”/10 cm - for the pattern as written, but will vary if you choose to knit yours at a different gauge with a different yarn/needle combo.

“Cocoon Chokki” is a top-down, relaxed-fit vest. ‘Chokki’ is a nostalgic Japanese word for ‘vest.’ Enjoy the loose-fitting wide mock neck and the silhouette that comfortably and gently wraps your shoulders and body like a cocoon. To start, the back shoulder pieces are shaped to form a back neck drop, then joined at the back neck and worked to the underarms. Stitches for the fronts are then picked up from the back shoulders, and worked back and forth to the underarms before being joined and worked in the round to the hem. The neck rib is worked in the round from picked-up stitches. The armhole bands are worked at the same time as the back and front, so the armhole depth can be shortened or extended according to your preference, just as the body length (note that this will affect the required amount of yarn).

Instructions for the cable pattern are charted only.
It is recommended to utilize the “cable without a cable needle” method for quicker results.
Please note: 1 skein of Heilo was enough to make the medium size; however there were only 2 meters of yarn left over. As all knitters are unique, an extra skein is suggested for peace of mind. If you do not end up needing it, make a second pair for a friend or loved one. :-)
The wave cable pattern is a modified version of a cable used for the Am Kamin sweater in the book “New Style of Heirloom Knitting”, by Toshiyuki Shimada.

Artus, with its striking blend of colors and patterning perfectly fits my grand design criteria. Artus is a rich tapestry of texture and color. The mosaic border is easy to work, allowing for creative color combinations that consistently produce fantastic results. Artus is not a delicate, sheer layering piece; instead, it’s a substantial wrap with a distinct presence. It stands out and adds character to any outfit while keeping you warm and cozy. It’s both eye-catching and functional, a true statement piece.
CONSTRUCTION Artus is a triangular shawl that is worked top-down from the center out, starting with a classic Garter Tab Cast On. The shawl features narrow bands of 1x1 color created using the stranded technique. The eye-catching border of the shawl is worked using the mosaic technique, holding only one strand of yarn on every row.
SIZES One size Wingspan approx 175 cm / 69”. Depth approx 70 cm / 27.5”.
YARN A sport weight yarn. Due to the floats produced by the mosaic technique it’s advisable to choose a yarn with a high wool content in a non-superwash quality. Sample is shown in Lichen and Lace Rustic Heather Sport, 100% wool, 197 m / 215 yards per 56 grams.
Color 1: approx 470 m / 515 yards. Color 2: approx 180 m / 195 yards. Color 3: approx 270 m / 295 yards. Color 4: approx 120 m / 130 yards. Color 5: approx 130 m / 142 yards.
Colorways sample C1: Shrub, C2: Ash, C3: Birch, C4: Pollen, C5: Sky.
NEEDLES Needle A (for the Waffle Pattern sections) One 100 cm / 40” (or longer) circular needle in size needed to obtain gauge listed. Suggested needle size: 3.5 mm / US #4. Needle B (for the stranded and mosaic color-work sections) One 100 cm / 40” (or longer) circular needle. Suggested needle size: 3.75 mm / US #5.
GAUGE Measured after blocking. Waffle Pattern: 22 sts x 40 rows = 10 x 10 cm / 4 x 4” on Needle A. Mosaic Colorwork: 22 sts x 60 rows = 10 x 10 cm / 4 x 4” on Needle B.

I used to think that summer knits weren’t for me, boy was I wrong! There is nothing more comfortable than an easy breezy knit top. Over the past few years I’ve been working steadily towards building up my summer knits wardrobe. I’ve got a few summer knits in my closet now but what I realize was missing is a staple, go-to, v-neck tee. I’ve chosen to create tone on tone stripes by alternating between fingering and mohair yarn in my favourite shade of blue, but this basic shape lends itself to infinite possibilities when it comes to stripes and colour blocking.
Knit top down, flat until the neck shaping is complete and in the round after that.

Roddin Fingerless mitts Our Roddin mitts are the perfect gift for everyone, showcasing a minimalist style with a stretchy, comfy rib and firmer ribbed cuff - these will be popular with recipients of all ages and genders! A fun, small project that you’ll find yourself giving away time and again. The best part? The long, foldover cuffs at the top allow can be folded back when you need to use your fingers and unfolded to keep them cosy when you don’t!
Construction begins with the cuffs, which are worked in a firmer 1x1 rib to ensure they stay on snugly and beautifully transitions to the bolder 2x2 rib that’s used for the rest of the mitts. Comfortable thumb shaping is worked with a single column of increases on the palm, creating a curved line that echoes the lifeline on the hand, allowing the ribbing to flow from the back of the hand over the thumb. After finishing the increases, put the stitches on hold to leave an opening for the thumb and continue working in the round for the rest of the hand section. Once this done, you complete the thumbs by returning to the held stitches to the needles and working the thumbs in the round.

Sailor Swift Top,Veronika Lindberg,Knitting,Tops → Sleeveless Top,Fingering (14 wpi)?,23 stitches and 35 rows = 4 inches in Stockinette stitch,US 2½ - 3.0 mm,296 - 612 yards (271 - 560 m),XS - 5XL,"English, German, Norwegian","crew-neck, female, icord, icord-edging, in-the-round, negative-ease, one-piece, racerback, seamless, stripes, top-down, worked-flat, written-pattern","Watch the full video tutorial for this pattern on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw7PArMh-ds
The Sailor Swift Top is a simple tank top with a slight racerback shape that gives it a contemporary look and a slight cool-girl vibe. The classic striped pattern together with the delicate i-cord edges around the neckline and armholes makes this a true wardrobe favorite that you’re going to want to wear (and knit) again and again.
The top is worked top down in Stockinette stitch, so you can adjust the length to suit your body. First the back is worked back and forth, then stitches are picked up for both fronts and then all stitches are joined in the round to work the body. Lastly stitches are picked up around the neckline and armholes for an i-cord bind off edge.
Sizes: XS (S, M, L) (XL, 2XL, 3XL) (4XL, 5XL)
Finished garment measurements: Bust circumference: 69.5 (76.5, 83.5, 90.5) (101, 108, 119) (132, 141) cm / 27.25 (30, 32.75, 35.5) (39.75, 42.5, 46.25) (52, 55.5) “. Length from underarm to hem: 31.5 cm / 12.5” all sizes.
The Sailor Swift Top is designed to have about 10 cm / 4” negative ease. The knitted fabric will stretch out when worn so choose a size that is approx. 10 cm/ 4” smaller than your bust for a good fit.
Sample in size S, Kika has a bust of approx. 87 cm / 34.25”.

Yarn suggestions: You can choose a fingering, sport or light DK weight yarn for the Sailor Swift Top. ➔ A thicker yarn, such as sport or light DK weight, will make the fabric denser, giving the finished garment more structure. ➔ A fingering weight yarn will produce a looser and more drapey fabric, giving the top a softer, more flowy feel.

8 other languagesshow, hide other languages","adult, buttonholes, female, one-piece, seamless, top-down, worked-flat, written-pattern","The Sunday Cardigan is knit from the top down with one strand of Inca Wool and two strands of silk mohair held together throughout the work. The yoke is knit back and forth in rib and shaped with increases. The button bands are knit simultaneously with the rest of the cardigan, so you do not have to pick up stitches at the end. The body and sleeves are knit in stockinette stitch and are finished with a wide rib edge. The sleeves are extra-long. The neckband is folded in and sewn to the wrong side. The button holes are constructed at the end by widening up a hole in the knit fabric (and are thus not worked as you knit the button band); they are secured and shaped by sewing along the edges of the button holes with buttonhole stitches (sewing).
NOTE: before casting on, you should knit a swatch to ensure that your needle size gives you the correct gauge of 12 sts per 10 cm. If you knit tightly, you might need to go up a needle size and use 8 mm needles. If your gauge is off, the size of the cardigan will be markedly different than the pattern suggests.
Size guide The Sunday Cardigan should have a positive ease of 8-12 cm compared to your actual bust circumference. The sizes XS (S) M (L) XL correspond to a bust measurement of approximately 85 (90) 95 (100) 110 cm. Note that the final measurements of the cardigan have those extra 8-12 cm already built in. Measure yourself to find the best size for you before casting on. For example, if you have a bust measurement of 90 cm, you should knit a size S (+9 cm of ease).

First the back of the yoke is worked, then the shoulders, then the front of the yoke and finally the body. Rib edges are worked at the neck edge and along the armholes.
Knit a swatch before beginning the project to check if the recommended needle size gives you the correct gauge. Note that broken rib stretches when washed and with wear. The gauge you can expect to have before wash/wear is approx. 24-25 sts in 10 cm [4 inches], which after wash/wear will grow to the correct gauge of 22 sts in 10 cm [4 inches]. The most important element in achieving the correct shoulder width and fit is knitting at the correct gauge, so be sure to wash and dry your swatch before measuring the gauge.
Size guide The Friday Slipover is designed to have approx. 6 cm [2¼ inches] of positive ease, meaning it is designed to be 6 cm [2¼ inches] larger in circumference than your bust measurement. The sizes XS (S) M (L) XL (2XL) 3XL (4XL) 5XL are designed to fit a bust circumference of 80-85 (85-90) 90-95 (95-100) 100-110 (110-120) 120-130 (130-140) 140-50 cm [31½-33½ (33½-35½) 35½-37½ (37½-39½) 39½-43¼ (43¼-47¼) 47¼-51¼ (51¼-55) 55-59 inches]. Before beginning your project, measure yourself with a measuring tape around your bust (or your widest upper body part) to determine which size will fit you the best. For example, if you measure 90 cm [35½ inches] around your bust (or your widest upper body part) you should knit a size S. A size S sweater has a bust circumference of 96 cm [37¾ inches], which in the given example would give you 5 cm [2 inches] of positive ease.

Friday Slipover is an ideal scrap yarn project, and the striped version is thus also knitted in scrap yarn. The stripes are knitted randomly underway. You can create a lovely effect in the color changes by choosing to work in a light color yarn as the mail color throughout and only changing the color of the silk mohair. If you want more pronounced stripes, use the same color in both types of yarn.

“Turtle doves are a symbol of friendship and love. Keep one, and give the other to a very special person. As long as each of you has your turtle dove, you will be friends forever.” – Home Alone 2.
With this design I wanted to create something special that is quick enough to make so that you can make one for yourself and one for a loved one. I have always thought shawls are the perfect design for gifts, because one size fits everyone.
This shawl was designed with those odd balls and leftover skeins of fingering weight yarn and mohair we all have in our stashes, but the shawl can also be worked in a single strand of DK weight yarn. Tip: If you don’t have enough of one color for the shawl, you could also work the first half of the scarf (until the end of increases) in one color and then the second side (decreasing part) in another color.
The Turtle Dove shawl is a little kerchief that can be worn in multiple ways. It is started at the tip of the shawl, then increased on every right side row until the full width before decreasing your way back to the other tip.
Size One size Total length: 100 cm / 40 inches Total width: 30 cm/ 11.75 inches
Yarn Note: The shawl uses a strand of fingering weight yarn held together with a strand of lace weight yarn, but they can be substituted for a single strand of DK weight yarn. If you wish to work a DK weight version, omit all the instructions where it says “hold the yarns together” and follow only the yarn amount requirements for the fingering weight yarn.
225 m / 246 yards of fingering weight yarn and 225 m / 246 yards of lace weight yarn.
Sample: 1 ball of Gepard Garn Wild & Soft (60 % merino wool, 40% tussah silk; 240 m / 262 yards per 50 g), shown in colorway 520 and 1 ball of (70% mohair, 30% silk; 225 m / 246 yards per 25 g).

I highly recommend diving into your stash (or the shelves of your LYS) and untwisting the skeins and then laying them next to each other. Look for nuances that can be seen from one color to the next - if your first color has some gold (like mine), why not snag an awesome speckled skein that also has some gold and another color you love (ahem - pink), so that after the speckled skein you can start stitching up that favorite pink skein you have been hoarding!

First, the top part of the back yoke is worked back and forth with increases, then the shoulders are worked from stitches that are picked up and knitted along the top of the back yoke. Stitches are then picked up and knitted along the shoulders, and the rest of the yoke is joined on a circular needle and worked with increases for the V-neck. The rest of the body is worked back and forth on a circular needle, and the sleeves are worked in the round. At the end, stitches are picked up and knitted along the front edges and a wide front placket is worked in 2 x 2 rib.

The measurements for the finished cardigan are listed on the front page of the pattern. Please note that these measurements are only achieved if the correct gauge is maintained. Measure yourself before starting your project, to determine which size will fit you the best.

A size S cardigan has a bust circumference of 116 cm [45¾ inches] which in the given example would give you 26 cm [10¼ inches] of positive ease.

Tunisian Crochet Ten Stitch Blanket,Dedri Uys,Crochet,Blanket → Throw,DK (11 wpi)?,gauge is not critical for this pattern,N/A,N/A,N/A,English,"one-piece, phototutorial, short-rows, square, stripes-colorwork, tunisian, unisex, worked-flat, written-pattern","This Tunisian Crochet Ten Stitch Blanket is a conversion of Frankie Brown’s Ten Stitch Blanket Knitting Pattern.
A while ago I approached Frankie and asked her if it would be okay for me to write a crochet version of her blanket. I was thrilled to bits when she agreed.
No sooner had I finished the pattern for the Crochet Ten Stitch Blanket, though, than I started working on the Tunisian Crochet Ten Stitch Blanket (both with Frankie’s blessing and encouragement).
And here, for your hooking pleasure, is the resulting pattern.
I would like to thank Frankie once again for letting me convert her wonderful pattern into another medium (if you can call it that).
This pattern is FREE, but if you would like to show your appreciation for Frankie and her designs, you are more than welcome to make a donation to the Children’s Liver Disease Foundation through Frankie’s Just Giving Page.
The Ten Stitch Blanket is worked in a spiral (or “rounds of rows”) around a central square of 10 stitches by 10 rows. The beauty of the project is that the short rows (10 stitches per row, less on the corner rows) propel you forward like you wouldn’t believe and it is the perfect pattern for using up any and every scrap of yarn in your house.
If you decide that your Ten Stitch Blanket is large enough, simply stop at the end of one of the Middle Sections and work a slip stitch row as indicated at the end of the pattern.
And have I mentioned that you don’t even need a tunisian crochet hook for this? Because there are so few stitches in each row, a regular old crochet hook will do (and might even be easier to wield).
You don’t really need to know how to do Tunisian crochet either. Each step is explained thoroughly with loads and loads of photos to help you on your merry way.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Have fun!

For example, if you measure 90 cm [35½ inches] around your bust (or around the widest part of your upper body) you should knit a size S. A size S cardigan has a bust circumference of 95 cm [37½ inches] which in the given example would give you 5 cm [2 inches] of positive ease.

Kallias is an open front cardigan and is worked seamlessly from the top down.
Knitting starts with the back part of the neckband. Stitches are then picked up from the long edge of the neckband to work the back part of the yoke first. Increases along the slanted shoulder “seam” are worked on both RS and WS rows. Once the final back width is reached, the back is worked back and forth in slip stitch ribbing to underarm. Stitches for the fronts (left and right front) are picked up from the shoulder “seam” to work the fronts back and forth to underarm. At underarm both fronts and back are joined to work the body top down back and forth to the short row shaped bottom hem. As the front ribbing is built in, there is no finishing required. Sleeve stitches are picked up around the arm openings to work the sleeves in Stockinette stitch top down in rounds to the cuffs.

Because this is a free pattern, I’m not able to provide pattern support. If you have any questions, you’re welcome to post them in the Crochet With Rachy Facebook group to get help from the community.",https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/mother-of-dragons-dice-bag

Winters Beach is worn open and is the perfect layering sweater - complete with pockets, of course. This sweater is knit from bottom up to the shoulders, then sleeves are picked up around the armholes and knit down. Pockets are placed while knitting the body of the sweater and finished at the end.

First the back yoke is worked flat back and forth while short rows hare worked to shape the shoulders. Then, each shoulder is worked separately, back and forth and with short rows. The shoulders are then joined to form the front yoke. The front and back yoke are joined at the underarms to form the body, which is worked in the round on a circular needle. Along the neck and armhole stitches are picked up and knitted and a stockinette stitch edge is worked.
Knit a swatch before beginning the project to check if the recommended needle size gives you the correct gauge.

For example, if you measure 90 cm [35½ inches] around your bust (or around the widest part of your upper body) you should knit a size S. A size S top has a bust circumference of 92 cm [36¼ inches] which in the given example would give you 2 cm [¾ inches] of positive ease.

The fit is slightly oversized, but the wide rib edges and the shorter length give the sweater a feminine silhouette. The No Frills Sweater is worked from the top down, which makes it easy to try it on along the way, so you can customize it to fit your body and end up with the perfect sleeve and body length for you. If you want to make sure that the rib neck edge keeps it shape over time, you can sew a thin elastic thread along the edge. Start by knitting a swatch to determine which needle size gives you the correct gauge.
Size guide The No Frills Sweater is designed to have approx. 15 cm [6 inches] of positive ease, meaning it is designed to be 15 cm [6 inches] larger in circumference than your chest measurement. The sizes XS (S) M (L) XL (2XL) 3XL are designed to fit a chest circumference of 80-85 (85-90) 90-95 (95-100) 100-110 (110-120) 120-130 cm [31½-33½ (33½-35½) 35½-37½ (37½-39½) 39½-43¼ (43¼-47¼) 47¼-51¼ inches]. The measurements for the finished garment are on the front page of the pattern (note that these measurements are only achieved if the sweater is knitted in the correct gauge). Before beginning your project, measure yourself with a measuring tape around your bust (or your widest upper body part) to determine which size will fit you the best. For example, if you measure 93 cm [36½ inches] around your bust (or around the widest part on your upper body) you should knit a size M. A size M sweater has a bust circumference of 108 cm [42½ inches], which in the given example would give you 15 cm [6 inches] of positive ease.

Update Version 3.0 on 16. Feb. 2022: Ranunculus includes now 11 sizes, size 3 is same as before, sizes 1 & 2 are smaller size, sizes 4–11 are larger size. Spanish pattern on 13. Apr. 2022 & French pattern on 09. May. 2022. If you have purchased this pattern before update, please update your pattern in your Ravelry Library (click “my notebook“ at the upper right, scroll down to ”Library“, then click “update“ bellow this pattern), then you can download new version.

Ranunculus is a top-down round yoke pullover with lace and textured stitches. I have designed yoke pattern to look like wearing layers of necklace. I have knitted short rows between neckribbing and yoke pattern not only on back bit also on front, so that neckline has a bit boat neck shape and yoke pattern has necklace look. The round yoke has ample depth and finished pullover has cropped length so that you can lay it over dresses or high-waisted skirts and pants. If crops aren’t your style, please adjust body to your favorite length.
You can choose from smaller or wider neckline, and short sleeves or long puff sleeves with/without diagonal cuff line.
You can use lace, light fingering to worsted weight yarn. The degree of transparency depends on the weight of yarn. Knitting with thin yarn on big needle gives light, transparent and airy texture to this pullover. Using thicker yarn or holding two yarns together adds more weight, and more structured look.
I hope you can enjoy knitting!

ラナンキュラスはレースと立体的な模様の丸ヨークのセーターです. ヨークの模様はネックレスを重ね付けしたところをイメージして作ってみました.
襟ぐりとヨークの模様の間に引き返し編みで段差をつけています. 上から下に向かって編んでいくトップダウンのセーターでは後ろ身頃に引き返し編みの段差をつけることが多いのですが, このパターンでは前身頃にも引き返し編みの段差をつけています. 前身頃にも段差をつけることで, ネックラインの形がボートネックに近くなり, 模様がネックレスのように下に少し垂れた形になります.
ヨークは深めに, 着丈はワンピースやハイウエストのボトムに合わせることを想定して短めにデザインしました. トップダウンのセーターなので編んでいる途中で試着してお好みの丈に調節することができます. 長めの着丈がお好みの場合は糸を多めに用意して, 身頃の丈を長めにアレンジしてみて下さい.
襟ぐりは作り目の方法を変えることで小さめの襟ぐり, もしくはルーズな襟ぐりにすることがでいます. 袖は編みっぱなしの半袖, パフスリーブの長袖, 長袖の袖口を斜めにする編み方を用意しました.
極細糸から太めの並太糸まで, お好きな太さの糸で編んでいただけます. 糸の太さで編み地の透け具合が変わりますので, スワッチを編んで, お好みの編み地になった糸を使って下さい. 楽しんで編んでいただけると嬉しいです.

It comes from two Greek words: “anthos” which means “flower”; and “logia” which means “collection”, or “gathering”.
A gathering of flowers.
It’s a beautiful way to think of how we collect stories, poems, and songs, and anything else important to us. And it’s a beautiful name for this exuberant throw, with its gardenful of colours and textures. Designed to use a set of 24 fingering minis or scraps, the Anthology Throw would also look incredible in a gradient set.
The Anthology Throw is a circular, Pi-inspired project, big and versatile enough to work as a blanket or a generous wrap. Drape it over the couch for epic snuggle sessions or double it up into an extra-cosy shawl. Its sheer scale may seem daunting, but trust me, it’s so easy and comforting to make!

Knitvent 2022 is a collection of six secret accessory patterns for you to discover and knit, one by one. It’s all about gifts, surprises and holiday knitting to delight you and the lucky folks on your knitworthy list!
It’s the 10th anniversary of the Curious Handmade Knitvent tradition, and this collection captures the eclectic joy of bits and pieces, treasured odds and ends, special scraps and the little things we love to stash away.
For Knitvent number 10, I wanted to do something a little different. Every year since 2017, the “scrappy” pattern has been the star of each Knitvent. It’s always the biggest project in the collection, designed to be made out of 24 mini skeins, whether pulled from your stash or a curated festive set from an indie dyer. This year, I had so much fun designing that project that all I wanted to do was make more projects out of minis.
And I decided on the spot that the whole collection would be in mini skeins.
So whether you’re a stash diver who loves to forage for beautiful scraps…
Or if you’ve got a precious set of minis but aren’t in the mood to commit to a giant project….
Or if you just want to knit a series of gorgeous gifts with any yarn that steals your heart…
You’re going to have a lot of fun this Knitvent.
Knitvent is a cross between a holiday countdown and a mystery knit along. The experience of getting a secret knitting pattern in your inbox each week brings back the childhood joy of surprises. It’s all about anticipation, surprise, and homemade gifts you can make for yourself and your loved ones…even if you’ve left it until almost the last minute.
Over the course of five festive weeks, you will receive a series of secret mystery knitting patterns, each designed to be a quick and satisfying knit. There’s a strong community aspect with a busy knitalong and lovely prizes, bustling chat threads on Ravelry and tons of inspiration on Instagram with the hashtag #knitvent2022
So join us for a lighthearted exploration of holiday movies and handknit presents! We’d love to have you along.

The pattern is straightforward, simple to memorize and quite addicting. What’s not to love?
Yarn 100 g of Sandnes Garn Line (110 meters (120 yards) / 50 g)
Measurements Length from tip to tip: ~145 cm (~57 inch) Width at center: ~25 cm (~10 inch)
Needles 4 mm (US 6) circular needles, at least 60 cm (24 inch) long
Gauge 20 sts and 35 rows in 10 cm (4 inch) in garter stitch
Notes

The scarf is worked flat, back and forth, from one tip to the other, and it’s all garter stitch with built-in i-cord edges and beautiful eyelets throughout.
You’ll be using half of your yarn for the first half of the scarf (increasing from the tip to the midway point) and the remaining half of your yarn for the second half of the scarf (decreasing from the mid-way point to the other tip). This will avoid leftovers and ensure your scarf is as big as possible!
You can easily adjust the length, based on the amount of yarn you have (just split it in half before you start knitting).
In addition to the written instructions, you can also refer to the charts you’ll find on the last two pages.

An Italian Summer Scarf è una sciarpetta dal look classico, facilissima da adattare in lunghezza, tipo di filato o suo contenuto. Il modello è chiaro, semplice da memorizzare e parecchio appassionante. Cosa c’è di meglio?
Filato 100 g di Sandnes Garn Line (110 metri / 50 g)
Misure Lunghezza da una punta all’altra: ~145 cm Larghezza al centro: ~25 cm
Ferri Ferri circolari da 4 mm (US 6), lunghi almeno 60 cm
Tensione 20 maglie e 35 ferri in 10 cm a maglia legaccio
Note

La sciarpa è lavorata in piano, avanti e indietro, da una punta all’altra, ed è tutta a maglia legaccio con bordi i-cord e delicati trafori su tutta la lunghezza.
Userete metà del filato per la prima parte della sciarpa (aumentando dalla punta fino al punto centrale) e la seconda metà del filato per la seconda parte della sciarpa (diminuendo dal punto centrale fino all’altra punta). Questo eviterà rimanenze di filato e garantirà che la vostra sciarpa sia il più grande possibile!
Potete facilmente adattare la lunghezza, in base alla quantità di filato che avete (semplicemente dividetela a metà prima di iniziare a lavorare).
In aggiunta alle istruzioni scritte, potete fare riferimento anche ai diagrammi che trovate nelle ultime due pagine.

First, the back yoke is worked back and forth and shaped with increases. Then, the shoulders are worked from stitches that are picked up and knitted along the top of the back yoke. The body is worked back and forth. The sleeves are worked in the round on a circular needle from stitches that are picked up and knitted along the armhole openings. At the end, front plackets are worked as well as a ribbed neck edge.
Begin by knitting a swatch to determine which needle size will give you the correct gauge in the textured pattern. The swatch can be worked using a chart in the pattern.

The sizes XXS (XS) S (M) L (XL) 2XL (3XL) 4XL (5XL) are designed to fit a bust circumference of 75-80 (80-85) 85-90 (90-95) 95-100 (100-110) 110-120 (120-130) 130-140 (140-150) cm [29½-31½ (31½-33½) 33½-35½ (35½-37½) 37½-39½ (39½-43¼) 43¼-47¼ (47¼-51¼) 51¼-55 (55-56) inches]. The measurements for the finished garment are on the front page of the pattern. Before beginning your project, measure yourself to determine which size will fit you the best. For example, if you measure 90 cm [35½ inches] around your bust (or around the widest part on your upper body) you should knit a size S. A size S jacket has a bust circumference of 114 cm [45 inches] which in the given example would give you 24 cm [9½ inches] of positive ease.

The cake version comes wrapped in a simple marzipan coat, with sugar sprinkles. So I made a border of simple stitches to match, with a dusting of picots along the edges.
Skill Level Easy/Intermediate This pattern uses a basic motif with a simple border pattern and a joining method which is a new technique, however a full video tutorial is included.
Yarn Any yarn type or weight can be used to make a blanket in this style and the yardage amounts required will depend on the weight of yarn you choose and the size of blanket that you require. See ‘Making a Battenberg Blanket’ on page 4 for more information.
To make a blanket of 1020 (34 x 30) squares in mostly 4ply/fingering weight yarn I used:
Drops Merino Baby 50g/175m (191yards) 100% merino yarn 26 x Off White - 02 (2 of which were used for the border)
Colourful Squares Approximately 800g/3,200m (3,500yards) of various 4ply/fingering weight sock yarns in a range of colours.
Needles/Hook 3mm (C/D USA) - Or appropriate hook size for your yarn choice.

Worthy of Note This hat begins with a provisional cast on, then a deep folded brim is worked in a K1, P1 Ribbing. Once the ribbing is complete, the provisional cast on is unpicked and placed on a spare circular needle and the stitches are joined to created a folded brim.
After the brim is complete, the body of the hat is worked in a texture stripe pattern from a chart. The chart is worked 4 times around. Decreases shape the crown and a pom pom completes the look.
Please Note: This is not a beginner pattern, but it is a great introduction to working from charts. Both the body of the hat and the crown decreases are worked from a chart.

It is knitted seamlessly top down with a diamond cable pattern that is a lot easier than it first appears and is suitable for knitters who are just learning to knit cables.
The Book club cardigan is started at the back neck and then increased to the full width of the back. After that stitches are picked up along the sloped shoulders for the fronts. The pieces are joined at the underarm and the body is then knitted in one piece. The sleeve stitches are then picked up from the body and worked in the round.
The length of the body and sleeves are easily modified to suit your own body measurements. I recommend trying the cardigan on every now and then while working on it to make sure you get the perfect length for your style.

Yarn Note: The pattern uses a strand of sport weight yarn held together with lace weight silk mohair, but it can be substituted for a strand of worsted weight yarn. If you wish to work a worsted version, work the cardigan using a single strand of yarn and follow the yarn requirements for the sport weight yarn only.

I noticed the first one because I stare at anything knit, whether machine-made or handmade. When I saw the second one, I assumed it must be a coincidence. But after I saw the third one, I turned to my husband and exclaimed, “I must knit that hat!” Then when I went home for a visit and hung out with a hometown friend, she was wearing the same hat I saw in Chicago, and I nearly tore it off her head in excitement. I obsessively analyzed it, counting stitches and rounds so I could faithfully replicate it. Since then, I found out it’s a popular slouchy beanie by Cheveux Corp (C.C). The original hat has hundreds of positive reviews and appears to look good on anyone regardless of gender, age, face shape, and hairstyle (or lack thereof). It is, in my opinion, the perfect unisex hat with the perfect amount of slouch!
EDIT: Due to multiple requests, this pattern has been updated with a note about converting this hat into a “Messy Bun Beanie” - but keep in mind, this hat is meant to be slightly slouchie, and Messy Bun Beanies are more form-fitting!

This large semi-circular shawl is knitted top-down with a collage of lace stitches and simple textures. Gather three colors of fingering weight yarn in a colorful fade or gradient from light to dark, then add three coordinating colors of lace weight mohair from light to dark. The three mohair accents are held together with the lightest color at the beginning of the shawl in a beautiful dip stitch pattern. The mohair colors are also used on their own with decorative eyelets and stripes in the border. This subtle mohair frost gives a beautiful halo and silky sheen to the fabric. The lace patterns feature delightful details like twisted ribbing, cables, and bold geometric formations. A chevron border frames the shawl for a dramatic final edge.

update 09/17: SPANISH translation available
when I saw BT Imbue for the first time - on photos - I was amazed by the vivid colors. Spoilt by choice I decided to choose grey (you can never go wrong with grey, no?) … and when I finally held the skeins in hand, it was immediately clear to me that the design had to reflect the wonderful characteristics of this yarn: Being thick and strong but soft and gentle at the same time. Elah is a cosy cardigan, nicely thick, so that it can easily be layered as a jacket, but with its delicate leafy lace pattern it goes just as well with a summer dress….. hope you enjoy
Elah is worked seamlessly from the top down. Fronts are worked in lace pattern, while the back is worked in Stockinette stitch. Knitting starts with the provisional cast on of the shoulders for the fronts (you will first work the right front, then the left front). Once the short row shaped shoulder slope is done, the front is worked flat to underarm. Shoulder stitches are picked up from the provisional CO of both front shoulders to work the back to the same length. At underarm both fronts and back are joined to work the body top down back and forth to the bottom hem. As the front ribbing is built in, there is no finishing required.

Vanten Alma är en varm och rustik vante stickad i tjockt ullgarn. Jag har stickat upp vanten i isländska lettlopi (blå vante) samt i Järbo 3 trådig svensk ull (röd vante). Min skickliga teststickare Maria har även stickat upp vanten i Tant Koftas strikkegarn. Resultaten i de olika garnen skiljer sig något. I Lettlopi får du en fluffig vante med ett mönster som flyter ihop snyggt. I Järbo svensk ull blir vanten slätare och varje maska går att urskilja, denna version blir något styvare i materialet men mjukas upp vid användning. I Tant koftas Strikkegarn, ett tjusigt garn med fantastisk glans, får du en tjock vante med lyxig känslas, då detta garn är aningen tunnare än de andra två blir det bra att sticka på en lite större sticka. För dig som är känslig för stickiga garner är Tant Koftas Strikkegarn eller Järbo svensk ull att rekommendera då Lettlopi upplevs som stickigt av många. Alla varianterna blir mycket varma. Vanten är rak i modellen men stickas med en tumkil som ger en bra passform runt tummen. Alla diagram återfinns i slutet av mönstret.

The mitten Alma is a warm and rustic mitten knitted in thick wool yarn. I have knitted the mittens in Icelandic Lettlopi (blue mittens) and in Järbo 3 thread Swedish wool (red mittens). My skilled test knitter Maria has also knitted the mittens in Tant Koftas Strikkegarn. The results between the different yarns differ slightly. In Lettlopi you get a fluffy mitten with a pattern where the colours blend together nicely. In Järbo Swedish wool, the mittens become smoother and each stitch can be distinguished, this version becomes slightly stiffer in the material but softens during use. With Tant koftas Strikkegarn, a nice yarn with fantastic shine, you get a thick mitten with a luxurious feeling, as this yarn is slightly thinner than the other two, it will be good to knit on a slightly larger needle. All varieties become very warm. The mittens are straight in the model but are knitted with a thumb gusset that gives a good fit around the thumb. All diagrams are found at the end of the pattern.

A 6 month cardigan will use most of a 100 gram (220 yard) skein. For size 12 month you will need about 30 yards more.

5 other languagesshow, hide other languages","adult, female, in-the-round, ribbed, textured, top-down, twisted-stitches, unisex, worked-flat, written-pattern","The Ingrid Slipover is worked from the top down in a knit and purl texture pattern. First, the back yoke is worked back and forth and the sloping shoulders are shaped using short rows. Then stitches are picked up and knitted for the shoulders, which are worked separately and then joined to form the front yoke. The front and back yoke are joined at the underarms to form the body, which is worked straight down in the round. Rib edges are worked along the armhole openings and at the neck. The Ingrid Slipover is worked in a texture pattern, which consists of three different pattern sections, each one separated by an eyelet section.
Begin by knitting a swatch to determine which needle size you need to achieve the correct gauge before starting the project – note that the gauge needs to be correct both in width and height, for you to be able to achieve the measurements given at the top of the pattern.
Size guide The Ingrid Slipover is designed to have approx. 20 cm [8 inches] of positive ease, meaning it is designed to be approx. 20 cm [8 inches] larger in circumference than your bust measurement. The sizes XS (S) M (L) XL (2XL) 3XL (4XL) 5XL are designed to fit a bust circumference of 80-85 (85-90) 90-95 (95-100) 100-110 (110-120) 120-130 (130-140) 140-150 cm [30½-33½ (33½-35½) 35½-37½ (37½-39½) 39½-43¼ (43¼-47¼) 47¼-51¼ (51¼-55) 55-59 inches].
The measurements for the finished garment are given on the first page of the pattern. Before beginning your project, measure yourself to determine which size will fit you the best. For example, if you measure 90 cm [35½ inches] around your bust (or around the widest part on your upper body) you should knit a size S. A size S slipover has a bust circumference of 108 cm [42½ inches] which in the given example would give you 18 cm [7 inches] of positive ease.
Sizes: XS (S) M (L) XL (2XL) 3XL (4XL) 5XL
Bust circumference: 104 (108) 116 (120) 128 (140) 148 (156) 168 cm [41 (42½) 45¾ (47¼) 50½ (55) 58¼ (61½) 66¼ inches]

It shares a common word-ancestor with habitat, which brings to mind the downy nests and peaceful dens of wild things: a natural setting, a place where we somehow instinctively belong. It’s also a cousin of the humble habit which reminds us of all the small daily actions which make up our lives.
Habitation can be a verb, and there’s an important truth in that. Quite often, home is something we do. A building or place only becomes a home when we live there, when we fill it with memories, emotions, and hopes. Even if we live in one place our whole lives, with legions of ancestors behind us, a home is never a static thing. We feather our nests with soft, cosy things and decorate them with reminders of important moments in our lives. Making a home, making ourselves at home, is an ongoing, fluid, ever-shifting act.
The Habitation Throw is a generous, warm, and cuddly addition to any home. Knit it using the 24 minis from your yarn advent calendar, or make it from your stash of scraps, knitting in all the memories of projects past. Habitation was designed for fingering weight yarn, but it is endlessly adaptable, with its shifting colours, squishy garter stitch, strings of eyelets, and smart i-cord edging. Make it to suit your own life and your own home: big or small, one colour or two dozen, in whatever beautiful yarn weight you have to hand.

The Cooma cowl is fast and fun to knit and also a bit addictive. It would make a great gift for all your knit-worthy friends and family!

It is worked from the top down in stockinette stitch. First the back of the yoke is worked, then the shoulders, then the front of the yoke and finally the body. A split rib edge where the back section is worked a bit longer than the front section is worked at the hem. Rib edges are worked at the neck edge and along the armholes at the end, and finished with an Italian cast-off for a neat and lovely finish. Knit a swatch before beginning the project to check if the recommended needle size gives you the correct gauge. Note that three strands of yarn are held together throughout the pattern for a chunky look (two strands of worsted weight yarn and one strand of lace weight yarn).
Size guide Holiday Slipover is designed to have approx. 6 cm [2¼ inches] of positive ease, meaning it is designed to be 6 cm [2¼ inches] larger in circumference than your chest measurement. The sizes XS (S) M (L) XL (2XL) 3XL (4XL) 5XL are designed to fit a chest circumference of 80-85 (85-90) 90-95 (95-100) 100-110 (110-120) 120-130 (130-140) 140-50 cm [31½-33½ (33½-35½) 35½-37½ (37½-39½) 39½-43¼ (43¼-47¼) 47¼-51¼ (51¼-55) 55-59 inches]. Before beginning your project, measure yourself with a measuring tape around your bust to determine which size will fit you the best.
For example, if you measure 90 cm [35½ inches] around your bust (or the widest part on your upper body) you should knit a size S. A size S sweater has a bust circumference of 96 cm [37¾ inches], which in the given example would give you 5 cm [2 inches] of positive ease. If you would like a more oversize fit, chose a size larger than you would normally do.

DETAILS This cowl is the perfect all-the-time accessory! A fun and engaging knit with lots of squish that looks like an asymmetrical triangle shawl when worn, but it only takes a fiddle-free second to throw it on as the finish to every outfit! If you struggle styling shawls - then this cowl may be just the answer for you! It is knit flat sideways, on the bias, and then seamed up the back neck after blocking. This cowl utilizes Half-Fishermen’s Rib for the ultimate squish fabric and to create a really fun play on stripes!

I use to call these type of sweaters ‘Collar with sleeves’ :) because I am here for a maximum warm neck … and a good shoulder fit of course
The REBEL cardigan is worked seamlessly from the top down. Start working the collar separately. Then the back stitches are picked up from the collar and the upper back is shaped with increases. Stitches are then picked up from each side of the back to work the shoulders. All pieces are then joined to work the yoke with increases for the body and sleeves down to sleeve separation. The sleeve stitches are then placed on hold, underarm sts are cast on, and you continue to work the body to the bottom. After the body is completed, the sleeve sts are worked top down in the round to the end. Beside of weaving in the ends, there is no further finishing required.

Sie sind sehr griffig und dick, da sie quasi in der Runde gearbeitet werden und daher doppelt sind. Man kann seiner Phantasie freien Lauf lassen bezüglich der Anordnung der Farben. Auch Reste kann man sehr gut verwenden. Ich arbeite am liebsten mit 4 Farben, wovon ich von der “Hauptfarbe” 2 Knäuel benötige, von allen anderen Farben ist ein Knäuel ausreichend. Eine Maschenprobe ist nicht nötig, es wird auch keine spezielle Häkelnadel benötigt, eine ganz normale ist ausreichend.

The design uses either six or three colours, the latter of which I hope will encourage knitters new to Fair Isle colourwork.
I would recommend using 2 ply jumper weight (2ply equivalent to 4 ply/fingering weight) 100% Shetland wool for best results, the ultimate in keeping you warm.
The pattern is one size adult but the size can be changed using larger or smaller needle sizes. Please pay particular attention to the required tension as my knitting is close. Many others have used 2.75mm needles to achieve the correct size.
Buggiflooer is the Shetland word for sea campion which, growing in abundance around the Shetland coast, is the inspiration behind this design.
Alison’s hat is a distinctive design that incorporates traditional elements together with a flower motif. She chose the name Buggiflooer – a Shetland name for Sea Campion – which grows in abundance near her home by the sea.

Those lavish, exuberant depictions of the natural world are a feast for the eyes and the imagination. Lush flowers and forests, twining vines and ripe fruit, mythical creatures and exotic birds: all things bright and beautiful, woven together in glorious abundance. Twenty Four Birds is a tribute to Arts and Crafts legends William Morris and his daughter May, Edward Burne-Jones, and their fellow designers and artists, left us such a legacy of beauty and craftsmanship.
This pi-inspired shawl is on a grand scale, full of rich detail and texture, featuring stylised botanical lace motifs which shift into a circle of twenty four “birds” towards the border, But don’t let that intimidate you! The pattern is suitable for brave beginners through experienced shawl knitters: while the lace looks intricate and impressive, the stitches are straightforward and simple.
The pattern includes detailed instructions, charts and row-by-row stitch counts with the Curious Handmade Percentage Checklist™ pattern format.
The sample uses four skeins of fingering-weight yarn: three gentle speckled colourways arranged in a gentle fade, with a semisolid feature panel as a pop, but the design also looks stunning in a gradient or even a single colour.
This pattern was originally published as the Curious Handmade 2024 Mystery Knitalong, in six “clues”. The full pattern is now available as a single PDF.

6 Day Star Blanket,Betty McKnit,Crochet,Blanket → Throw,DK (11 wpi)?,N/A,N/A,1600 - 2450 yards (1463 - 2240 m),Various,English,"chevron, in-the-round, phototutorial, star-shaped, textured, video-tutorial, written-pattern","Crochet Pattern Only - Digital File 6-Day Star Blanket A Crochet Pattern by Betty McKnit
This viral crochet sensation is a variation of the classic 6-Day Kid Blanket. It is worked from the center out into the shape of seven-pointed star. As it turns out this version is just as addictive as the original! No one can make just one 6-Day Crochet Blanket.
This fun and easy pattern is adaptable, perfect for crocheters of all levels of experience. It is easy enough for new crocheters and interesting and addictive for the more seasoned. This blanket can be made in virtually any yarn, can be striped any number of ways, and you can stop at 12 rounds for a lovey size, or continue to grow your blanket as large as you want. The border is a very simple reverse single crochet.
What’s the difference between this blanket and the 6-Day Superstar, and 6-Day Supernova Blankets?
• The 6-Day Star blanket has seven points and is the easiest of the 6-Day Star Blankets. It has eight setup rounds and repeats the same 6 rounds after that. I suggest first timers and new crocheters start their 6-Day Crochet journey with the 6-Day Star.
• The 6-Day Superstar has 14 points and comes out almost circular with chevrons. It has a few more setup rounds than the 6-Day Star that some crocheters find more challenging than the 6-Day Star. Once the setup is complete, it is easy and repetitive, like the 6-Day Star.
• The 6-Day Supernova has a total of 14 points: 7 larger points and 7 smaller points. It isn’t difficult to make, but the pattern itself has lots of different rounds It is easier to understand once you’re familiar with the 6-Day Crochet style. Try the Supernova when you feel comfortable with the Star and you’re ready for a challenge.
• You can also make a 6-Day Star, Superstar, or Supernova Holiday Tree Skirt, a 6-Day Star, Superstar, or Supernova Shawl. Keep an eye out for more pattern adaptations from the 6-Day Star Blanket.
Details US Terminology with UK Conversions given Finished Size: Variable Skill Level: Easy Gauge: varies depending on your yarn.
Materials Yarn: this pattern works with almost any yarn. Yardage for the most common sizes are below. Check the chart at the end of this pattern for yardage estimates for more yarn and sizes.
• For DK or #3 weight yarn you will need approximately 1600 yards for a 40” baby blanket and 2800 yards for a 60” throw-sized blanket.
• For Worsted or #4 weight yarn you will need approximately 1500 yards for a 40” baby blanket and 2500 yards for a 60” throw-sized blanket.

On my walks through the »Treppenviertel« (Stairs District) in Hamburg I also enjoy – in addition to the view – when the northwest wind brings the smell of the sea.
With the Treppenviertel cowl, I am perfectly equipped for the cold. Thanks to its point, it fits snugly into the front of my jacket and keeps me warm all the way up to my ears.

På mine spadsereture gennem Hamburgs “Treppenviertel” (trappeområde) nød jeg også – sammen med udsigten, når nordvestenvinden bragte duften af havet med sig. Med “Treppenviertel Cowl” er jeg på bedste måde udrustet mod kulden. Takket være spidsen, som passer perfekt i frontåbningen på min jakke, holder jeg mig varm hele vejen op til ørerne.

Når vinden tar tak i skjerv og sjal er det på tide med «Treppenviertel Hals». Gjennom måten ribbstrikk er brukt på er den superelastisk og tettsittende samtidig. Og pga. spissen passer den utmerket i åpningen på jakker og kåper.

First the back yoke is worked back and forth while short rows are worked to shape the shoulders. Then each shoulder is worked separately, back and forth and with short rows. The shoulders are then joined to form the front yoke. The front and back yoke are joined at the underarms to form the body, which is worked in the round on a circular needle. The sleeves are worked from stitches that are picked up and knitted along the armhole openings. The sleeves are worked in the round.

The measurements for the finished sweater are listed on the front page of the pattern. Measure yourself before starting your project, to determine which size will fit you the best. For example, if you measure 90 cm [35½ inches] around your bust (or around the widest part of your upper body) you should knit a size S. A size S sweater has a bust circumference of 113 cm [44½ inches] which in the given example would give you 23 cm [9 inches] of positive ease.

They are easy to wear, they will not fly off in a brisk wind, and they keep you warm. The Wolkig cowl is twisted and has extra volume due to strategically worked decreases and increases, so it can be stretched a little to fit comfortably over your head when putting it on. Stretched in the other direction (lengthwise), it will fit snugly around your neck without leaving any gaps where the cold wind might sneak in. Use only one skein of a luxurious merino-silk-blend (choose a multicolor for extra fun!), and watch the fascinating spirals grow under your hands.
The best thing is this: Wolkig (named after the German word for “cloudy”) has only one line of pattern. Take it out to knit night, on the bus, to the movies, everywhere – it is so easy that you will not need to take the pattern with you. Chatting to your friends or watching a fun flick will not mess this project up.
If you feel like it, you can use more yarn and work the cowl longer, so it doubles as a very cozy, cloudy tube scarf.
Measurements: Width (i. e. half circumference) = 36 cm / 14.5 inches Length: 52 cm / 21 inches
If you would like a longer tube, work more repeats. If you would like a wider tube, cast on more stitches (multiples of 50).

•••••••••••••• In der „First Fall & Holiday Headstart 2017“-Ausgabe des Strickmagazins Knitty ist meine Anleitung „Wolkig“ erschienen. Mit freundlicher Erlaubnis von Knitty durfte ich auf meiner Webseite die deutsche Übersetzung veröffentlichen. Viel Spaß beim Stricken!
Ich liebe Cowls – sie sind so praktisch, weil sie nicht verrutschen oder sich von selbst lösen, und sie halten warm. „Wolkig“ ist spiralig gedreht und bietet dadurch extra viel warmes Volumen. Diese Form entsteht durch geschickt platzierte Zu- und Abnahmen und ist schön elastisch. Beim Überziehen lässt sie sich in die Breite dehnen, so dass der Kopf (und die Frisur!) gut hindurchpasst, dehnt man ihn in die andere Richtung, sitzt er angenehm wärmend nah am Hals. Such Dir einen Strang extra-luxuriöses Merino-Seiden-Garn aus (semisolid oder multi) und lass beim Stricken die faszinierende Spiralform entstehen. Das beste an dieser Anleitung: Sie besteht aus nur einer Zeile. Nimm Dein Projekt mit zum Stricktreff, in den Bus, ins Kino – es ist so einfach zu stricken, dass Du die Anleitung gar nicht mitzunehmen brauchst. Mit Deinen Freundinnen zu quatschen oder nebenher einen Film zu gucken ist gar kein Problem. Falls Du magst, kannst Du auch mehr Garn benutzen und Deinen Cowl länger stricken, so dass Du ihn auch als sehr voluminösen Schal verwenden kannst.

The Merci Cloth is made with worsted weight 100% cotton yarn. I especially liked using Dishie for this yarn, as the tight twist keeps the yarn from splitting and helps with stitch definition. This pattern looks best with solid, heathered, or self striping yarns. I would avoid variegated.

I love reusable bags, I usually take some anywhere when I’m out in town for shopping! That’s why I created this beautiful market bag.
I used my Sakura Face Scrubbies pattern and extended it to create this beautifully textured bottom part which gives some extra touch to the final product!
I used Paintbox Yarns Cotton DK in lime green colourway. It is a very vibrant colour and brightens up a gloomy day. :)
It is an easy pattern but a bit more advanced because of some special stitches used. Written in US terms only.

First, the back yoke is worked back and forth with the shoulder slope shaped using short rows. Then, each front is worked separately while increases are worked to the shape the V-neckline. Front and back yoke are then joined to form the body, which is worked in the round on a circular needle to the hem. The ribbed neck edge and armhole edges are worked at the end.
Begin by working a swatch to determine which needle size you need to achieve the correct gauge.
Size guide The Weekend Slipover V-neck is designed to have approx. 15-20 cm [6-7¾ inches] of positive ease, meaning it is designed to be 15-20 cm [6-7¾ inches] larger in circumference than your bust measurement. The sizes XS (S) M (L) XL (2XL) 3XL (4XL) 5XL are designed to fit a bust circumference of 80-85 (85-90) 90-95 (95-100) 100-110 (110-120) 120-130 (130-140) 140-150 cm [31½-33½ (33½-35½) 35½-37½ (37½-39½) 39½-43¼ (43¼-47¼) 47¼-51¼ (51¼-55) 55-59 inches].
The measurements for the finished garment are on the front page of the pattern. Before beginning your project, measure yourself to determine which size to knit. For example, if you measure 90 cm [35½ inches] around your bust (or around the widest part of your upper body) you should knit a size S. A size S slipover has a bust circumference of 108 cm [42½ inches], which in the given example would give you 18 cm [7 inches] of positive ease.
The model in the photos is wearing a size XS and has a bust circumference of 82 cm [32¼ inches] and is 164 cm [approx. 5 feet 4 inches] tall.

6 other languagesshow, hide other languages","adult, female, in-the-round, oversized, positive-ease, textured, top-down, unisex, worked-flat","The Ingrid Sweater is worked from the top down in a knit and purl texture pattern. First, the back yoke is worked back and forth and the sloping shoulders are shaped using short rows. Then stitches are picked up and knitted for the shoulder sections, which are also shaped using short rows. The shoulder sections are then joined to form the front yoke. The front and back yoke are joined at the underarms to form the body, which is worked straight down in the round. The sleeves are knitted in the round from stitches that are picked up and knitted along the armholes. The Ingrid Sweater is worked in a texture pattern, which consists of three different pattern sections, each one separated by an eyelet section.
Begin by knitting a swatch to determine which needle size you need to achieve the correct gauge before starting the project – note that the gauge needs to be correct both in width and height, for you to be able to achieve the measurements given at the top of the pattern.
Size guide The Ingrid Sweater is designed to have approx. 20 cm [8 inches] of positive ease, meaning it is designed to be approx. 20 cm [8 inches] larger in circumference than your bust measurement. The sizes XS (S) M (L) XL (2XL) 3XL (4XL) 5XL are designed to fit a bust circumference of 80-85 (85-90) 90-95 (95-100) 100-110 (110-120) 120-130 (130-140) 140-150 cm [30½-33½ (33½-35½) 35½-37½ (37½-39½) 39½-43¼ (43¼-47¼) 47¼-51¼ (51¼-55) 55-59 inches].
The measurements for the finished garment are given on the first page of the pattern. Before beginning your project, measure yourself to determine which size will fit you the best. For example, if you measure 90 cm 35½ inches around your bust (or around the widest part on your upper body) you should knit a size S. A size S sweater has a bust circumference of 112 cm 44 inches, which in the given example would give you 22 cm 8½ inches of positive ease.
Sizes: XS (S) M (L) XL (2XL) 3XL (4XL) 5XL

It is super easy to knit, requires only a few techniques and is therefore ideal for beginners. In addition to the SABAI Top No. 1 with ribbed borders, there is also a second, completely in stockinette stitch, knit version - the SABAI Top No. 2.
The SABAI Top No. 1 is worked seamlessly top down. First, the neckline border is worked in the round in a 1/1 rib stitch pattern and increases are worked for the slanted shoulders. For the armholes, front and back parts are worked separately back and forth. The stitches of front and back are then joined and worked in the round again. The top ends with a narrow ribbed border with a rolled edge. As the top is knitted from the top down, it is possible (and advisable) to try it on while knitting so that the length can be individually adjusted.
Techniques used: left- and right leaning knitted and purled increases.
Sizes XS (S) M (L) XL (XXL)
To fit chest circumference: 74-81 (82-89) 90-97 (98-107) 108-117 (118-127) cm / 30-32 (33-35) 36-38 (38-42) 43-46 (47-50)”
Measurments Chest circumference: 85 (91) 99 (109) 121 (131) cm / 33.4 (35.8) 39 (42.9) 47.6 (51.6)” Total length: 47 (49) 51 (54) 57 (60) cm / 18.5 (19.3) 20.1 (21.3) 22.4 (23.6)” Armhole depth: 21 (22) 22 (23) 24 (25) cm / 8.3 (8.7) 8.7 (9.1) 9.5 (9.8)”
The top can be worn snug with approx. 0 - 2 cm / 0 – 0.8” positive ease, but also works well with a little more room to move (5 - 8 cm / 2 – 3.2” positive ease). For example, if you have a chest circumference of 90 cm / 35.4”, you should choose between size S and M.
Yarn 200 (250) 250 (300) 350 (400) g ‚Cecilia‘ by Svarta Fåret (53 % Cotton, 33 % Viscose, 14 % Linen, 110 m/ 50 g) or 200 (250) 250 (300) 350 (400) g ‚Line‘ by Sandnes Garn (53 % Cotton, 33 % Viscose, 14 % Linen, 110 m/ 50 g), or 200 (200-250) 250 (300) 350 (350-400) g ‚Perla‘ by Lamana (60 % Cotton, 25 % Alpaca, 15 % Silk, 115 m/50 g).
Tips for yarn choices Several yarn qualities are recommended in the instructions, a few words about them: ‚Cecilia’ und ‚Line’ have the same composition, a summery cotton-linen mix. This makes the top loose and flowing. ‚Perla’ is a cotton yarn with alpaca and silk. This makes the top a bit thicker because the yarn is more voluminous.

Speedy Selbu Mittens,Skeindeer Knits,Knitting,Hands → Mittens,Aran (8 wpi)?,18 stitches  = 4 inches,US 9  - 5.5 mm,N/A,Women's S/M and M/L,"English, Norwegian","adult, bottom-up, chart, female, gusset, in-the-round, norwegian, ribbed, stranded, written-pattern","This is the even faster, even simpler Aran weight version of my DK Selbu Mittens. They are just as ideal for those new to colourwork mittens, with their row-by-row instructions not typically offered in most charted Norwegian patterns. Once you have made these, you should be able to knit colourwork mittens from a chart. I’m happy to offer pattern support, so please don’t hesitate to ask for help.
To kick off ‘The Selbu Miten Club II’, I’ve created this bonus pattern: A simple and unbelievably quick pair of colourwork mittens in the classic Selbu Mitten style. The club will take you on journey from Aran, to DK, to Sport to Fingering weight mittens. Advancing your colourwork knitting skills for each upcoming pattern.
Some practical info:
Yarn

1 x 100m/50g Aran/chunky yarn for the main colour
1 x 100m/50g Aran/chunky yarn for the contrast colour

Needle(s) Needle size will vary depending on your gauge and the size you desire. But generally:

1 x DPNs or magic loop circular gauge size needle
1 x DPNs or magic loop circular 1 1/2 mm below gauge size needle

Gauge

20sts per 10cm/4” for a snug 9cm width fit
18per 10cm/4” for a comfortable 10cm width fit

So, choose whichever needle size helps you achieve a 18-20 sts per 10cm/4” gauge. As a fairly tight knitter I would opt for 6mm/US7 for a comfortable 18sts gauge.

Sizeguide Levitate Wrap has an oversize fit. The smaller sizes have a greater positive ease than the larger sizes in order to complement the individual body the best. Calculate a positive ease of approx. 30-35 cm 11.75-13.75 inches in size XS-XL and approx. 20 cm 8 inches in size 2XL-4XL.
The sizes XS (S) M (L) XL (2XL) 3XL (4XL) are equivalent to the European standard sizes 34 (36) 38 (40) 42 (44) 46 (48) and suit a bust circumference of approx. 80-85 (85-90) 90-95 (95-100) 100-110 (110-120) 120-130 (130-140) cm 31.5-33.5 (33.5-35.5) 35.5-37.5 (37.5-39.5) 39.5-43.25 (43.25-47.25) 47.25-51.25 (51.25-55) inches. For example: You measure 89 cm 35 inches at your bust + 30-35 cm 11.75-13.75 inches = 119-124 cm 46.75 - 48.75 inches. Meaning you would choose a size S with a circumference of 123 cm 48.5 inches.

The geometric adventure begins with modular sections that form curved and straight stripes. Bands of bubbles and brioche lead to a scalloped short row edging. There are also instructions to knit eyelets instead of brioche if you choose to knit an easy non-brioche option. Then, stitches are picked up from the first sections to create the top center of the shawl with tiny bobbles and slip stitches. An optional wavy border is included to make the shawl larger. 200g of each color is enough yarn to knit the shawl.
If you want to incorporate a Mohair Dare, add one or two colors of lace weight mohair silk to your color combo in a matching color or add a fluffy contrast color pop. The instructions include notes where you can incorporate a Mohair Dare. Have fun customizing the Go Go Dynamo Shawl. Each section is bursting with bold stripes and entertaining techniques.

This year’s shawl features two contrasting colors of fingering weight yarn, 200g of the MC (Main Color) & 200g of the CC (Contrast Color).   Yardage Approximately 1572yds / 1440m total MC (Main Color) - 786yds / 720m CC (Contrast Color) - 786yds / 720m   If your fingering weight yarn comes in 100g skeins, then you will need 2 skeins of each color. If yarn comes in 50g skeins/balls, you will need 4 skeins/balls of each color. You may have some leftovers, but it’s best to have the recommended amount of yarn listed above.

Notions 2 stitch markers, tapestry needle   Gauge  24 sts & 48 rows = 4″ / 10cm in garter stitch before blocking   Try to get close to the recommended stitch gauge to ensure you don’t run out of yarn. A similar stitch gauge is more important than getting an exact row gauge.   Garter Stitch Swatch If you would like to see how your colors interact, cast on 30 stitches and knit some colorful stripes, knitting on the right side and wrong side for garter stitch.   I recommend striping the colors by knitting 4 rows of each color, resulting in 2 garter ridges for each stripe like this…   Knit 4 rows with MC. Knit 4 rows with CC. Knit 4 rows with MC. Knit 4 rows with CC.   Repeat those stripes to visualize your color relationship and check your stitch gauge.

Yarn note (from knitty.com): Debbie Bliss Cashmerino Aran is beautiful and soft and comes in gorgeous colors. The cool thing about these gloves is that you only need one skein to make a pair. However, you have to be willing to unravel your gauge swatch to do this, because one pair takes an entire skein with less than a yard of yarn left over. If you feel the need to keep your gauge swatches, you will need to buy two skeins. Also, note that the gauge listed on the yarn label is 18 stitches over 4 inches, while the gauge for this pattern is 21 stitches over 4 inches. That’s because smaller-than-recommended needles are used to create the thick, velvety knitted fabric.  Finished measurements: Cuff circumference: 7 inches (unstretched); Length: 6.25 inches 
Description from knitty.com:
 
These fingerless gloves come                              pretty close to instant knitting gratification:                              buy your yarn on Friday after work, and by Sunday                              evening you can have a new pair of stylish handwarmers                              to enhance your Monday commute. 
 
The cables hold the gloves                              nicely at your wrist and across your knuckles,                              and are excellent for keeping you warm yet unhindered                              while knitting, typing, or enjoying a coffee                              at an outdoor café. If you have never                              tried knitting cables before, this would be                              an excellent project to start with. The cable                              pattern is simple, and if you make a mistake                              and end up having to rip out some rows, it shouldn't                              take you long to catch up.

First the back yoke is worked and shaped using short rows to form the slope of the shoulders. After this, stitches are picked up and knitted for each shoulder, which are then joined to form the front yoke. The front and back yoke are joined to form the body, which is worked straight down in the round. The sleeves are worked in the round on double-pointed needles or on a circular needle using the Magic Loop technique. Finally, stitches are picked up at the neckline to work a ribbed edge, which is then folded over towards the inside to form a double neckband, which is closed by knitting the stitches together with the pick-up edge.
Knit a swatch to determine which needle size you need to achieve the correct gauge – note that this can vary from yarn to yarn. Take care to wash the swatch before measuring, as the texture pattern can grow with wash.
Size guide The Moby Sweater is designed to have approx. 15-20 cm [6-8 inches] of positive ease, meaning it is designed to be approx. 15-20 cm [6-8 inches] larger in circumference than your bust measurement. The sizes XS (S) M (L) XL (2XL) 3XL (4XL) 5XL are designed to fit a bust circumference of 80-85 (85-90) 90-95 (95-100) 100-110 (110-120) 120-130 (130-140) 140-150 cm [30½-33½ (33½-35½) 35½-37½ (37½-39½) 39½-43¼ (43¼-47¼) 47¼-51¼ (51¼-55) 55-59 inches].
The measurements for the finished garment are given on the first page of the pattern. Before beginning your project, measure yourself to determine which size will fit you the best. For example, if you measure 90 cm [35½ inches] around your bust (or around the widest part on your upper body) you should knit a size S. A size S sweater has a bust circumference of 106 cm [41¾ inches] which in the given example would give you 16 cm [6¼ inches] of positive ease.

The yoke is worked in sections of rib with increases in the round, followed by classic raglan increases when the stockinette stitch section begins. The sleeves are worked at the end, either on double-pointed needles or on circular needles using the Magic Loop technique. Anker’s Summer Shirt has no finishing other than weaving in ends. Begin by working a swatch to determine which needle size you need to achieve the correct gauge. Note that the swatch needs to be washed and blocked before measuring the gauge.
Size guide Anker’s Summer Shirt is designed to have approx. 0-5 cm [0-2 inches] of positive ease, meaning it is designed to be 0-5 cm [0-2 inches] larger in circumference than your widest upper body measurement. The sizes XS (S) M (L) XL (2XL) 3XL (4XL) 5XL are designed to fit a bust circumference of 80-85 (85-90) 90-95 (95-100) 100-110 (110-120) 120-130 (130-140) 140-150 cm \31½-33½ (33½-35½) 35½-37½ (37½-39¼) 39¼-43¼ (43¼-47¼) 47¼-51¼ (51¼-55) 55-59 inches]. The measurements for the finished garment are on the front page of the pattern (note that these measurements are only achieved if the correct gauge is kept). Before beginning your project, measure yourself with a measuring tape around your bust (or your widest upper body part) to determine which size will fit you the best. For example, if you measure 95 cm [37½ inches] you should knit a size M. A size M shirt has a finished circumference of 96 cm [37¾ inches], which in the given example would mean 1 cm [½ inches] of positive ease.

PATTERN NOTES
This is a two-in-one pattern. You have the pattern for the long, tapered mitts in three sizes, as well as a pattern for the shorter, non-tapered version in three sizes.
Be sure to bind-off all sections purl-wise to make a clean edge that matches the cast-on edge. This isn’t crucial, as the edges will naturally curl, but for those of us who prefer matching cast-on and bind-off edges, this helps.
If you tend to leave ladders when using DPNs (like me) they will be noticeable in this knit. Be sure to pull tightly on the second stitch on each needle or try the Magic Loop.",https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/fire-pit-mitts-2

First, the back yoke is worked and shaped using short rows to form the slope of the shoulders. After this, stitches are picked up and knitted for each shoulders, which are then joined to form the front yoke. The front and back yoke are joined to form the body, which is worked straight down in the round. The sleeves are worked in the round on double-pointed needles or on a circular needle using the Magic Loop technique. A rib edge is worked along the neck, folded double and knitted down. The Storm Sweater is worked in a texture pattern which has four different segments. Begin by knitting a swatch to determine which needle size will give you the correct gauge – please note that both the stitch gauge and the row gauge needs to be correct for the sweater to end up having the measurements given at the top of the pattern. The swatch can be worked using the chart in the pattern.

Each pattern ordered will include a tag for you to sign your first name or name the bear if you wish, and attach to your bear’s wrist before sending it back.

Have you been wanting to try Tunisian crochet, but just really want to dip your toes in the water, without taking on another large project?
Then these sweet crochet hearts are just the thing for you! They’re the perfect beginner Tunisian crochet project. You will learn all you need to know about how to do the Tunisian Simple Stitch, the most basic Tunisian stitch.
Once you get the hang of these you’ll be making them so quickly! Around 15 minutes for a single sided heart with edging, under 30 minutes for a double sided heart from start to finish!
A regular crochet hook (aluminium or ergonomic) can be used for this pattern, no need to purchase a Tunisian crochet hook.
Make these hearts for your friends, your children, your Mum or Grandmother - anyone you love!
This heart is perfect for any day of the year, including The classics: Valentine’s Day, Birthdays, Anniversaries, Random acts of crochet kindness, as a gift/card topper, creative patches on your clothing or just because you need a crochet heart. They also make wonderful wedding or party favours, or table decorations for these occasions.
These little cuties are quick to make, and use very little yarn. (5m for a single layered heart, 10m for a double sided heart in Sport weight/ 5ply/ Fine #2 yarn)
Choose to create a single layered heart as an appliqué, or join two hearts together, with or without a little stuffing, to create a cute and cuddly heart that fits perfectly into the palm of your hand.
The classic ric-rac style edging gives the hearts a professional and romantic finish that everyone will ‘ooh and ahh’ over!
Let your imagination soar, try using various yarns with appropriate hook sizes for different sized hearts. Add embroidered flowers or a simple message like ‘LOVE’ or ‘XO’ to the Tunisian Simple Stitch part of the heart as a gift for a special person in your life.
This Tunisian crochet heart pattern comes with a full video tutorial, detailed photo tutorial, clearly written pattern and email support.
If you’re completely new to Tunisian crochet, please watch the extra video linked inside the pattern just for you!
A number of pattern testers new to Tunisian crochet were successful the first time, following the written pattern with photos.
The pattern has been very thoroughly tested and tech edited.
There is a 2 page text-only printable section within the PDF for those who like to print out their patterns.
Remember this doesn’t contain the details, links or the help of the photos, so best to refer to the entire pattern for your first ones.
There are so many cute possibilities with this design:

Make a collection in your chosen colour scheme to feature on your dining table for Valentine’s Day
Make a bunch in your favourite colours and create a garland or add to a wreath base for a seasonal wreath.
Add to wrapped gifts or handmade cards.
Make as a cute Valentine’s Day gift, easy and quick enough to make a number of them, even one for each person in your child’s class!
Make tiny ones using embroidery thread or crochet thread (#3 or #10) and attach to a key chain, or length of crochet cord as a bookmark, to a necklace for a cute charm, or as a pair of adorable earrings.

Almost any yarn weight can be used for this project, with corresponding hook size.
I recommend using a hook size you would normally use for your chosen yarn, if not a touch larger. Tunisian Simple Stitch makes a thick fabric and you may need to experiment a little to find the best hook for your chosen yarn.

SUGGESTED YARN For the Traveler Hats I chose to use two of Brooklyn Tweed’s classic bases - Shelter and Loft. I love creating versatile patterns that come with more than one yarn weight option and lots of sizes, so as soon as I finished my first Traveler Hat in Shelter, I decided to cast on another in its fingering weight sibling, Loft. If you’ve heard me talk about yarn, then you probably know that my happy place is woolen spun yarns. Not only are they delightfully squishy and textured to knit with, but they are also very insulating thanks to having a core of air that is warmed by our own body temperature - creating the coziest of handknits!

Yarn amounts are estimates. Total yardage used will depend on the yarn you use, your gauge, and any modifications you may make. If using a sticky, bouncy yarn like an untreated wool choose a fingering, jumper or sport weight. If using a super wash or otherwise smooth, slippery yarn chose a sport or DK.
For best results wash and block your swatch exactly the way you plan to wash your finished sweater. The sweater shown has been washed with a gentle wool wash and gently smoothed into shape to dry flat.

This design is a collaboration with Rosa Pomar. There is now a cardigan version of the design, check out the Noctua cardigan !
ILHA is named after the art of basket weaving art from the Portuguese village Ilha. The textured yoke adorns the top of the sweater with a set of stitches reminiscent of braiding and weaving. ILHA is worked from the top down, in the round. After the delicate yoke, the top of the sweater is shaped with raglan increases, resulting in a comfortable sweater and well-defined armholes. Once the stitches of the sleeves are put on hold, the body is knitted in the round, with pretty braids on the sides, revealed during movements. The ribbed edges are nicely highlighted by broken lines of twist stitches. Rosa Pomar’s ALJORXE yarn is perfect for combining these textured stitches (thanks to its beautiful stitch definition) with stockinette stitch (thanks to its lightness and nice drape).

The first part of the yoke is worked with shoulder increases on both RS and WS rows. The next part is worked with sleeve increases and the final part with classic raglan increases. At the same time, increases are worked along the front edges to shape the V-neckline. The sleeves are worked in the round on double-pointed needles or on a circular needle using the Magic Loop technique. At the end, stitches are picked up and knitted along the fronts, shoulders and back of neck, and a ribbed front edge with buttonholes is worked. Begin by working a swatch to determine which needle size you need to achieve the correct gauge.
Size guide The April Cardigan is designed to have approx. 6-8 cm [2¼-3¼ inches] of positive ease, meaning it is designed to be 6-8 cm [2¼-3¼ inches] larger in circumference than your bust measurement. The sizes XS (S) M (L) XL (2XL) 3XL (4XL) 5XL are designed to fit a bust circumference of 80-85 (85-90) 90-95 (95-100) 100-110 (110-120) 120-130 (130-140) 140-150 cm [31½-33½ (33½-35½) 35½-37½ (37½-39½) 39½-43¼ (43¼-47¼) 47¼-51¼ (51¼-55) 55-59 inches]. The measurements for the finished garment are on the front page of the pattern (note that these measurements are only achieved if the design is knitted in the correct gauge). Before beginning your project, measure yourself with a measuring tape around your bust or your widest upper body part to determine which size will fit you the best. For example, if you measure 90 cm [35½ inches] around your bust (or around the widest part on your upper body) you should knit a size S. A size S sweater has a bust circumference of 97 cm [38¼ inches] which in the given example would give you 7 cm [2¾ inches] of positive ease.
